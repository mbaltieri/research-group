On Tuesday, September 17, 2024, the X Communication Team lead by Shuntaro 
Sasai was nominated for the BCI Award 2024. 
This time, the announcement of the TOP 12 for this award has been made, 
and the announcement of the TOP 3, who will be eligible for the award, 
will take place on Tuesday, October 8, 2024, at 9:00 PM (Japan time).
In the team’s paper “Scaling Law in Neural Data: Non-Invasive Speech 
Decoding with 175 Hours of EEG Data,” submitted to arXiv this July, 
they revealed that the accuracy of speech decoding, which has been 
challenging with non-invasive EEG, scales as the amount of data increases. 
In addition to this, the team made new discoveries, including that accuracy 
can be restored to the same level with just 30 minutes of data calibration, 
even with data from seven months later, and that the model trained on 
long-duration data can be efficiently transferred to other subjects.
