### Discovery of Shared Brain Activity Patterns between Mothers and Children when Solving Math Problems

An international joint research team from France and Japan, including 
Tomoya Nakai, has for the first time revealed that brain activity 
patterns when tackling math problems are shared between mothers and 
their 8-year-old children. 
This discovery was made by measuring the brain activity of parent-child 
pairs using fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging). 
The study was published on August 12th in the American academic journal 
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).

**Key Points of the Study**
- First-ever fMRI demonstration that brain activity patterns for solving 
 math problems are strongly similar between mothers and children.
- Specific similarities unique to mother-child pairs were observed in 
 brain regions involved in complex cognitive functions (anterior insula and 
 precentral gyrus).
- The brain similarities correlate with the similarity in math abilities 
 between mothers and children, suggesting a neural basis for the 
 intergenerational transfer of skills.
 

**Study Overview**
It is widely known from previous research in educational and developmental 
psychology that parents’ cognitive abilities significantly influence their 
children’s academic performance and development. 
Similarities between parents and children extend not only to physical 
appearance but also to personality, attitude, and learning strengths and 
weaknesses. 
It has also been reported that learning disabilities affecting reading, 
writing, and arithmetic tend to run in families. However, the neural 
mechanisms explaining these similarities in learning abilities were not 
yet fully understood.

Therefore, an international joint research team from the Lyon Neuroscience 
Research Center and Araya Inc. measured brain activity in 37 mother-child 
pairs (8-year-old children and their mothers) using fMRI while they performed 
single-digit addition and subtraction tasks and calculated the similarity of 
their brain activity patterns (Figure A).

The results showed similar generational brain activity patterns in multiple 
regions, including the parietal, frontal, and insular cortices, regardless of 
whether a parent-child relationship existed. 
This suggests that the human brain utilizes a somewhat common neural network 
for math processing across generations.

Furthermore, when the analysis was limited to the “mother-child” relationship, 
it was confirmed that the brain activity of parents and children was particularly 
similar in the left precentral gyrus and the bilateral anterior insular cortex 
(more so than in completely unrelated child-adult pairs) (Figure B). 
These regions are known to be involved in complex cognitive functions such as 
attentional control and working memory (the ability to temporarily hold information). 
This result suggests that the functional characteristics of the brain regions 
related to math may be inherited from parent to child.

Interestingly, this similarity in brain activity was also linked to the similarity 
in math abilities between mothers and children. This trend was particularly strong 
in mothers who struggled with math problems. These findings provide insight into 
how cognitive abilities are passed on at the brain level and are expected to be 
used for risk assessment of learning disabilities and the design of individually 
optimized educational support.
