Hiro Hamada will talk about DeSci in session 02 starting from 11:10am of 
the launch event of De-Silo! 
De-Silo is a project to explore “what kind of times we are living in now” 
by relying on the knowledge of academia, “socialization of concepts” 
through collaboration between researchers and artists, support for researchers 
through the Academic Incubator Program, information dissemination and 
management of the Discord community and the project will experiment with 
fundraising by applying the DeSci mechanism.
