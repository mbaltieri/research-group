abstract: A significant problem in neuroscience concerns the distinction between neural
  processing that is correlated with conscious percepts from processing that is not.
  Here, we tested if a hierarchical structure of causal interactions between neuronal
  populations correlates with conscious perception. We derived the hierarchical causal
  structure as a pattern of integrated information, inspired by the integrated information
  theory (IIT) of consciousness. We computed integrated information patterns from
  intracranial electrocorticography (ECoG) from six human neurosurgical patients with
  electrodes implanted over lateral and ventral cortices. During recording, subjects
  viewed continuous flash suppression (CFS) and backward masking (BM) stimuli intended
  to dissociate conscious percept from stimulus, and unmasked suprathreshold stimuli.
  Object-sensitive areas revealed correspondence between conscious percepts and integrated
  information patterns. We quantified this correspondence using unsupervised classification
  methods that revealed clustering of visual experiences with integrated information,
  but not with broader information measures including mutual information and entropy.
  Our findings point to a significant role of locally integrated information for understanding
  the neural substrate of conscious object perception.
