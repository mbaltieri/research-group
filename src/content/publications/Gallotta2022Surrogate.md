abstract: When generating content for video games using procedural content generation
  (PCG), the goal is to create functional assets of high quality. Prior work has commonly
  leveraged the feasible-infeasible two-population (FI-2Pop) constrained optimisation
  algorithm for PCG, sometimes in combination with the multi-dimensional archive of
  phenotypic-elites (MAP-Elites) algorithm for finding a set of diverse solutions.
  However, the fitness function for the infeasible population only takes into account
  the number of constraints violated. In this paper we present a variant of FI-2Pop
  in which a surrogate model is trained to predict the fitness of feasible children
  from infeasible parents, weighted by the probability of producing feasible children.
  This drives selection towards higher-fitness, feasible solutions. We demonstrate
  our method on the task of generating spaceships for Space Engineers, showing improvements
  over both standard FI-2Pop, and the more recent multi-emitter constrained MAP-Elites
  algorithm.
