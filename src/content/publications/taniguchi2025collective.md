abstract: This article proposes a new conceptual framework called collective predictive
  coding as a model of science (CPC-MS) to formalize and understand scientific activities.
  Building on the idea of CPC originally developed to explain symbol emergence, CPC-MS
  models science as a decentralized Bayesian inference process carried out by a community
  of agents. The framework describes how individual scientists’ partial observations
  and internal representations are integrated through communication and peer review
  to produce shared external scientific knowledge. Key aspects of scientific practice
  like experimentation, hypothesis formation, theory development and paradigm shifts
  are mapped onto components of the probabilistic graphical model. This article discusses
  how CPC-MS provides insights into issues like social objectivity in science, scientific
  progress and the potential impacts of artificial intelligence on research. The generative
  view of science offers a unified way to analyse scientific activities and could
  inform efforts to automate aspects of the scientific process. Overall, CPC-MS aims
  to provide an intuitive yet formal model of science as a collective cognitive activity.
