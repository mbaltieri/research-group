abstract: While falsifiability has been broadly discussed as a desirable property
  of a theory of consciousness, in this paper, we introduce the meta-theoretic concept
  of “Universality” as an additional desirable property for a theory of consciousness.
  The concept of universality, often assumed in physics, posits that the fundamental
  laws of nature are consistent and apply equally everywhere in the universe and remain
  constant over time. This assumption is crucial in science, acting as a guiding principle
  for developing and testing theories. When applied to theories of consciousness,
  universality can be defined as the ability of a theory to determine whether any
  fully described dynamical system is conscious or non-conscious. Importantly, for
  a theory to be universal, the determinant of consciousness needs to be defined as
  an intrinsic property of a system as opposed to replying on the interpretation of
  the external observer. The importance of universality originates from the consideration
  that given that consciousness is a natural phenomenon, it could in principle manifest
  in any physical system that satisfies a certain set of conditions whether it is
  biological or non-biological. To date, apart from a few exceptions, most existing
  theories do not possess this property. Instead, they tend to make predictions as
  to the neural correlates of consciousness based on the interpretations of brain
  functions, which makes those theories only applicable to brain-centric systems.
  While current functionalist theories of consciousness tend to be heavily reliant
  on our interpretations of brain functions, we argue that functionalist theories
  could be converted to a universal theory by specifying mathematical formulations
  of the constituent concepts. While neurobiological and functionalist theories retain
  their utility in practice, we will eventually need a universal theory to fully explain
  why certain types of systems possess consciousness.
