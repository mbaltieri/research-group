abstract: Neural networks encounter the challenge of Catastrophic Forgetting (CF)
  in continual learning, where new task knowledge interferes with previously learned
  knowledge. We propose Remembering Transformer, inspired by the brain's Complementary
  Learning Systems (CLS), to tackle this issue. Remembering Transformer employs a
  mixture-of-adapters and a generative model-based routing mechanism to alleviate
  CF by dynamically routing task data to relevant adapters. Our approach demonstrated
  a new SOTA performance in various vision continual learning tasks and great parameter
  efficiency.
