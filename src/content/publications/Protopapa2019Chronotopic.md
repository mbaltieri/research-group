abstract: Time is a fundamental dimension of everyday experiences. We can unmistakably
  sense its passage and adjust our behavior accordingly. Despite its ubiquity, the
  neuronal mechanisms underlying the capacity to perceive time remains unclear. Here,
  in two experiments using ultrahigh-field 7-Tesla (7T) functional magnetic resonance
  imaging (fMRI), we show that in the medial premotor cortex (supplementary motor
  area [SMA]) of the human brain, neural units tuned to different durations are orderly
  mapped in contiguous portions of the cortical surface so as to form chronomaps.
  The response of each portion in a chronomap is enhanced by neighboring durations
  and suppressed by nonpreferred durations represented in distant portions of the
  map. These findings suggest duration-sensitive tuning as a possible neural mechanism
  underlying the recognition of time and demonstrate, for the first time, that the
  representation of an abstract feature such as time can be instantiated by a topographical
  arrangement of duration-sensitive neural populations.
