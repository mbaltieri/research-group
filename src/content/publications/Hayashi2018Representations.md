abstract: Precise time estimation is crucial in perception, action and social interaction.
  Previous neuroimaging studies in humans indicate that perceptual timing tasks involve
  multiple brain regions; however, whether the representation of time is localized
  or distributed in the brain remains elusive. Using ultra-high-field functional magnetic
  resonance imaging combined with multivariate pattern analyses, we show that duration
  information is decoded in multiple brain areas, including the bilateral parietal
  cortex, right inferior frontal gyrus and, albeit less clearly, the medial frontal
  cortex. Individual differences in the duration judgment accuracy were positively
  correlated with the decoding accuracy of duration in the right parietal cortex,
  suggesting that individuals with a better timing performance represent duration
  information in a more distinctive manner. Our study demonstrates that although time
  representation is widely distributed across frontoparietal regions, neural populations
  in the right parietal cortex play a crucial role in time estimation.
