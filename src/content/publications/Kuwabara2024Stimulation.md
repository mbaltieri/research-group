abstract: In individuals afflicted with conditions such as paralysis, the implementation
  of Brain-Computer-Interface (BCI) has begun to significantly impact their quality
  of life. Furthermore, even in healthy individuals, the anticipated advantages of
  brain-to-brain communication and brain-to-computer interaction hold considerable
  promise for the future. This is attributed to the liberation from bodily constraints
  and the transcendence of existing limitations inherent in contemporary brain-to-brain
  communication methods. To actualize a comprehensive BCI, the establishment of bidirectional
  communication between the brain and the external environment is imperative. While
  neural input technology spans diverse disciplines and is currently advancing rapidly,
  a notable absence exists in the form of review papers summarizing the technology
  from the standpoint of the latest or potential input methods. The challenges encountered
  encompass the requisite for bidirectional communication to achieve a holistic BCI,
  as well as obstacles related to information volume, precision, and invasiveness.
  The review section comprehensively addresses both invasive and non-invasive techniques,
  incorporating nanotech/micro-device technology and the integration of Artificial
  Intelligence (AI) in brain stimulation.
