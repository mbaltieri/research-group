abstract: The massless Dirac equation is studied in curved space-time on the (2+1)-dimensional
  graphene sheet in time-dependent geometries. Emergent pseudogauge fields are found
  both in the adiabatic regime and, for high-frequency periodic geometries, in the
  nonadiabatic regime for a generic Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker metric in
  Fermi normal coordinates. The former extends the conventionally understood homogeneous
  pseudogauge field to include weak temporal inhomogeneities. The latter, through
  the usage of Floquet theory, represents another class of emergent pseudogauge field
  and is argued to potentially provide a condensed matter realization of cosmological
  high-frequency geometries.
