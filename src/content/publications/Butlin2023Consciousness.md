abstract: 'Whether current or near-term AI systems could be conscious is a topic of
  scientific interest and increasing public concern. This report argues for, and exemplifies,
  a rigorous and empirically grounded approach to AI consciousness: assessing existing
  AI systems in detail, in light of our best-supported neuroscientific theories of
  consciousness. We survey several prominent scientific theories of consciousness,
  including recurrent processing theory, global workspace theory, higherorder theories,
  predictive processing, and attention schema theory. From these theories we derive
  ”indicator properties” of consciousness, elucidated in computational terms that
  allow us to assess AI systems for these properties. We use these indicator properties
  to assess several recent AI systems, and we discuss how future systems might implement
  them. Our analysis suggests that no current AI systems are conscious, but also suggests
  that there are no obvious technical barriers to building AI systems which satisfy
  these indicators.'
