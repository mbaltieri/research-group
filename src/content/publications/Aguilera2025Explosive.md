abstract: Higher-order interactions underlie complex phenomena in systems such as
  biological and artificial neural networks, but their study is challenging due to
  the scarcity of tractable models. By leveraging a generalisation of the maximum
  entropy principle, we introduce curved neural networks as a class of models with
  a limited number of parameters that are particularly well-suited for studying higher-order
  phenomena. Through exact mean-field descriptions, we show that these curved neural
  networks implement a self-regulating annealing process that can accelerate memory
  retrieval, leading to explosive order-disorder phase transitions with multi-stability
  and hysteresis effects. Moreover, by analytically exploring their memory-retrieval
  capacity using the replica trick, we demonstrate that these networks can enhance
  memory capacity and robustness of retrieval over classical associative-memory networks.
  Overall, the proposed framework provides parsimonious models amenable to analytical
  study, revealing higher-order phenomena in complex networks.
