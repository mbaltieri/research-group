abstract: Female researchers in Japan face unique challenges caused by cultural and
  institutional norms, making their career progression more difficult than in other
  developed countries. Overcoming these barriers and fostering an inclusive academic
  environment require a systematic approach that includes targeted interventions and
  clear, enforceable measures to ensure compliance and accountability.
