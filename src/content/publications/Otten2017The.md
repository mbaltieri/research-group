abstract: Vision in the fovea, the center of the visual field, is much more accurate
  and detailed than vision in the periphery. This is not in line with the rich phenomenology
  of peripheral vision. Here, we investigated a visual illusion that shows that detailed
  peripheral visual experience is partially based on a reconstruction of reality.
  Participants fixated on the center of a visual display in which central stimuli
  differed from peripheral stimuli. Over time, participants perceived that the peripheral
  stimuli changed to match the central stimuli, so that the display seemed uniform.
  We showed that a wide range of visual features, including shape, orientation, motion,
  luminance, pattern, and identity, are susceptible to this uniformity illusion. We
  argue that the uniformity illusion is the result of a reconstruction of sparse visual
  information (from the periphery) based on more readily available detailed visual
  information (from the fovea), which gives rise to a rich, but illusory, experience
  of peripheral vision.
