abstract: Deciding whether to wait for a future reward is crucial for acquiring rewards
  in an uncertain world and involves anticipating future reward attainment. While
  seeking for a reward in natural environments, behavioral agents constantly face
  a trade-off between staying in their current environment or leaving it. It remains
  unclear, however, how humans make continuous decisions in such situations. Here
  we show that anticipatory brain activity in the anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC)
  and hippocampus underpins continuous stay-leave decision making. Human participants
  awaited for real liquid rewards available after tens of seconds, and continuous
  decision was tracked by monitoring dynamic patterns of brain activity. Participants
  stopped waiting more frequently and sooner after they experienced longer delays
  and received smaller rewards. When dynamic activity reflecting the anticipation
  of a future reward was enhanced in the aPFC, participants remained in their current
  environment, but when this activity diminished, they left the environment for a
  new one. The anticipatory activity in the aPFC and hippocampus was associated with
  distinct decision strategies; aPFC activity was enhanced in participants adopting
  a leave strategy, whereas those remaining stationary showed enhanced activity in
  the hippocampus. Our results suggest that fronto-hippocampal anticipatory dynamics
  underlie continuous decision making while anticipating a future reward.
