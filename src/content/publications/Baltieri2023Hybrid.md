abstract: 'Artificial life is a research field studying what processes and properties
  define life, based on a multidisciplinary approach spanning the physical, natural
  and computational sciences. Artificial life aims to foster a comprehensive study
  of life beyond "life as we know it" and towards "life as it could be", with theoretical,
  synthetic and empirical models of the fundamental properties of living systems.
  While still a relatively young field, artificial life has flourished as an environment
  for researchers with different backgrounds, welcoming ideas and contributions from
  a wide range of subjects. Hybrid Life is an attempt to bring attention to some of
  the most recent developments within the artificial life community, rooted in more
  traditional artificial life studies but looking at new challenges emerging from
  interactions with other fields. In particular, Hybrid Life focuses on three complementary
  themes: 1) theories of systems and agents, 2) hybrid augmentation, with augmented
  architectures combining living and artificial systems, and 3) hybrid interactions
  among artificial and biological systems. After discussing some of the major sources
  of inspiration for these themes, we will focus on an overview of the works that
  appeared in Hybrid Life special sessions, hosted by the annual Artificial Life Conference
  between 2018 and 2022.'
