abstract: Integrated information theory (IIT) starts from consciousness itself and
  identifies a set of properties (axioms) that are true of every conceivable experience.
  The axioms are translated into a set of postulates about the substrate of consciousness
  (called a complex), which are then used to formulate a mathematical framework for
  assessing both the quality and quantity of experience. The explanatory identity
  proposed by IIT is that an experience is identical to the cause-effect structure
  unfolded from a maximally irreducible substrate (a Φ-structure). In this work we
  introduce a definition for the integrated information of a system (φs) that is based
  on the existence, intrinsicality, information, and integration postulates of IIT.
  We explore how notions of determinism, degeneracy, and fault lines in the connectivity
  impact system integrated information. We then demonstrate how the proposed measure
  identifies complexes as systems whose φs is greater than the φs of any overlapping
  candidate systems.
