abstract: We introduce a novel framework to identify perception-action loops (PALOs)
  directly from data based on the principles of computational mechanics. Our approach
  is based on the notion of causal blanket, which captures sensory and active variables
  as dynamical sufficient statistics—i.e. as the “differences that make a difference.”
  Furthermore, our theory provides a broadly applicable procedure to construct PALOs
  that requires neither a steady-state nor Markovian dynamics. Using our theory, we
  show that every bipartite stochastic process has a causal blanket, but the extent
  to which this leads to an effective PALO formulation varies depending on the integrated
  information of the bipartition.
