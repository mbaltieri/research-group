abstract: When aligning human and AI systems, the process typically involves independently
  sharing human value systems, concepts underly- ing them, and the outputs of behavior
  between humans and AI systems. However, these systems are interconnected and aligned
  at different lev- els, and a simultaneous approach may achieve greater synergistic
  effects. Here, we propose a concept-network alignment approach that achieves conceptual
  and behavioral outputs using psychological and neuroscien- tific methods. First,
  we summarize existing approaches to emulate hu- man behavior and the representation
  of the human brain from multi- ple perspectives. We then emphasize the opportunities
  and challenges of concept-network alignment. We further discuss evaluations of concept-
  network alignment at behavioral, representation, and predictive, mecha- nistic levels.
