abstract: Although the anatomical arrangement of brain regions and the functional
  structures within them are similar across individuals, the representation of neural
  information, such as recorded brain activity, varies among individuals owing to
  various factors. Therefore, appropriate conversion and translation of brain information
  is essential when decoding neural information using a model trained using another
  person’s data or to achieving brain-to-brain communication. We propose a brain representation
  transfer method that involves transforming a data representation obtained from one
  person’s brain into that obtained from another person’s brain, without relying on
  corresponding label information between the transferred datasets. We defined the
  requirements to enable such brain representation transfer and developed an algorithm
  that distills the assumption of common similarity structure across the brain datasets
  into a rotational and reflectional transformation across low-dimensional hyperspheres
  using encoders for non-linear dimensional reduction. We first validated our proposed
  method using data from artificial neural networks as substitute neural activity
  and examining various experimental factors. We then evaluated the applicability
  of our method to real brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging
  response data acquired from human participants. The results of these validation
  experiments showed that our method successfully performed representation transfer
  and achieved transformations in some cases that were similar to those obtained when
  using corresponding label information. Additionally, we reconstructed images from
  individuals’ data without training personalized decoders by performing brain representation
  transfer. The results suggest that our unsupervised transfer method is useful for
  the reapplication of existing models personalized to specific participants and datasets
  to decode brain information from other individuals. Our findings also serve as a
  proof of concept for the methodology, enabling the exchange of the latent properties
  of neural information representing individuals’ sensations.
