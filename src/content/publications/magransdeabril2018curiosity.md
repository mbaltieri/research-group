abstract: 'We propose a curiosity reward based on information theory principles and
  consistent with the animal instinct to maintain certain critical parameters within
  a bounded range. Our experimental validation shows the added value of the additional
  homeostatic drive to enhance the overall information gain of a reinforcement learning
  agent interacting with a complex environment using continuous actions. Our method
  builds upon two ideas: i) To take advantage of a new Bellman-like equation of information
  gain and ii) to simplify the computation of the local rewards by avoiding the approximation
  of complex distributions over continuous states and actions.'
