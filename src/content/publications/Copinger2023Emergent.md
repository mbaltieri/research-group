abstract: Motivated by the fermionic Berry’s phase in momentum space, we study a local
  Abelian phase in momentum space coupled to electromagnetism, for complex scalars
  in the phase-space worldline formalism. The interaction of both Abelian fields is
  shown to give rise to a momentum gauge dependent emergent spacetime. As a concrete
  example, we further study classical solutions of the Berry-inspired gauge field
  that lead to an emergent Newtonian gravity with gravitational potential predicted
  by coupled Coulomb fields both in configuration and momentum spaces. Noncommutative
  aspects of the theory are also provided.
