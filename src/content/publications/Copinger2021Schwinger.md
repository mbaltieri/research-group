abstract: Schwinger pair production is analyzed in a Belavin, Polyakov, Schwarz and
  Tyupkin (BPST) instanton background and in its SL(2,C) complex extension for complex
  scalar particles. A non-Abelian extension of the worldline instanton method is utilized,
  wherein Wong’s equations in a coherent state picture adopted for SL(2,C) are solved
  in Euclidean spacetime. While pair production is not predicted in the BPST instanton,
  a complex extension of the BPST instanton, existing as parallel fields in Minkowski
  spacetime, is shown to decay via the Schwinger effect.
