abstract: 'This paper presents a new human activity recognition method that uses a
  camera mounted on a mobile robot. We assume that the robot''s camera captures images
  of a person and recognizes his/her activities based on skeletal and visual features
  extracted from the images. A key issue encountered with this method for activity
  recognition is that it requires the robot to position itself so that it has an adequate
  field of view of the activities being conducted. For example, if the robot is directly
  behind a person while observing that person making tea, it will be difficult for
  the robot to distinguish that activity from other similar activities such as preparing
  a meal or washing dishes. Our method employs deep reinforcement learning to control
  the movements of the mobile robot that is observing the activities in order to maximize
  its recognition accuracy while minimizing its energy consumption related to its
  movement. We propose effective action- and state-space designs that can achieve
  early training convergence and highly accurate activity recognition by: (i) incorporating
  the confidence of the activity recognition output when evaluating the quality of
  the current state (position), (ii) incorporating the costs of subsequent actions
  when estimating values for those actions, and (iii) designing an effective action
  space that accelerates reinforcement learning by restricting the movement space
  of the robot to the circumference of a circle with a predefined radius centered
  on the person.'
