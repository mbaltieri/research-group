abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) hold great potential for aiding individuals
  with speech impairments. Utilizing electroencephalography (EEG) to decode speech
  is particularly promising due to its non-invasive nature. However, recordings are
  typically short, and the high variability in EEG data has led researchers to focus
  on classification tasks with a few dozen classes. To assess its practical applicability
  for speech neuroprostheses, we investigate the relationship between the size of
  EEG data and decoding accuracy in the open vocabulary setting. We collected extensive
  EEG data from a single participant (175 hours) and conducted zero-shot speech segment
  classification using self-supervised representation learning. The model trained
  on the entire dataset achieved a top-1 accuracy of 48\% and a top-10 accuracy of
  76\%, while mitigating the effects of myopotential artifacts. Conversely, when the
  data was limited to the typical amount used in practice (∼10 hours), the top-1 accuracy
  dropped to 2.5\%, revealing a significant scaling effect. Additionally, as the amount
  of training data increased, the EEG latent representation progressively exhibited
  clearer temporal structures of spoken phrases. This indicates that the decoder can
  recognize speech segments in a data-driven manner without explicit measurements
  of word recognition. This research marks a significant step towards the practical
  realization of EEG-based speech BCIs.
