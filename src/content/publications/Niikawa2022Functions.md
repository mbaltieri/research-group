abstract: 'There are many theories of the functions of consciousness. How these theories
  relate to each other, how we should assess them, and whether any integration of
  them is possible are all issues that remain unclear. To contribute to a solution,
  this paper offers a conceptual framework to clarify the theories of the functions
  of consciousness. This framework consists of three dimensions: (i) target, (ii)
  explanatory order, and (iii) necessity/sufficiency. The first dimension, target,
  clarifies each theory in terms of the kind of consciousness it targets. The second
  dimension, explanatory order, clarifies each theory in terms of how it conceives
  of the explanatory relation between consciousness and function. The third dimension,
  necessity/sufficiency, clarifies each theory in terms of the necessity/sufficiency
  relation posited between consciousness and function. We demonstrate the usefulness
  of this framework by applying it to some existing scientific and philosophical theories
  of the functions of consciousness.'
