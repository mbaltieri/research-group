abstract: What is the biological advantage of having consciousness? Functions of consciousness
  have been elusive due to the subjective nature of consciousness and ample empirical
  evidence showing the presence of many nonconscious cognitive performances in the
  human brain. Drawing upon empirical literature, here, we propose that a core function
  of consciousness be the ability to internally generate representations of events
  possibly detached from the current sensory input. Such representations are constructed
  by generative models learned through sensory-motor interactions with the environment.
  We argue that the ability to generate information underlies a variety of cognitive
  functions associated with consciousness such as intention, imagination, planning,
  short-term memory, attention, curiosity, and creativity, all of which contribute
  to non-reflexive behavior. According to this view, consciousness emerged in evolution
  when organisms gained the ability to perform internal simulations using internal
  models, which endowed them with flexible intelligent behavior. To illustrate the
  notion of information generation, we take variational autoencoders (VAEs) as an
  analogy and show that information generation corresponds the decoding (or decompression)
  part of VAEs. In biological brains, we propose that information generation corresponds
  to top-down predictions in the predictive coding framework. This is compatible with
  empirical observations that recurrent feedback activations are linked with consciousness
  whereas feedforward processing alone seems to occur without evoking conscious experience.
  Taken together, the information generation hypothesis captures many aspects of existing
  ideas about potential functions of consciousness and provides new perspectives on
  the functional roles of consciousness.
