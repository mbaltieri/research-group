abstract: 'Introduction Fostering well-being and positive mental states are major
  aims of many strategies for the promotion of public mental health. Such strategies
  become increasingly important since many people worldwide suffer from psychological
  distress and mental disorders, resulting in substantial individual and societal
  costs. Within the last years, there is a shift from strategies solely focusing on
  the reduction of mental distress to those also aiming at the promotion of positive
  mental states. Correlates, that is, psychosocial resources, of positive mental states
  may represent a starting point for those interventions. To date, a comprehensive
  systematic review on those correlates is still missing as well as knowledge on culture-related
  differences.


  Methods and analysis A systematic review and meta-analysis on the longitudinal link
  between psychosocial resources (eg, income, optimism, social support and community
  coherence) and hedonic and eudaimonic positive mental states (eg, life satisfaction,
  happiness and forward-looking attitude) will be conducted. Using Hofstede’s dimensions
  of culture and global metrics of Education, Industrialisation, Richness and Democratic
  values (EIRDness), we will examine culture-related moderators of these associations.
  The systematic review will be conducted following standards of the Cochrane Collaboration
  and will be reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
  reviews and Meta-Analyse guidelines. Literature searches for primary studies will
  be carried out across four databases (APA PsycNet, Embase, Scopus and the Web of
  Science Core Collection), including all publications up to 27 January 2025. Screening
  at the level of titles and abstracts will be performed with the help of artificial
  intelligence software (ASReview). Study quality will be assessed using an adapted
  version of the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. We will employ multilevel meta-analyses of
  correlation coefficients, with cultural variables being examined as moderators.


  Ethics and dissemination This systematic review does not require ethics approval,
  as it solely uses previously published data. Materials and data used for this review
  will be shared via open repositories (https://osf.io/2xkhs/). Results will be published
  in an international, peer-reviewed journal and presented at conferences including
  plain language summaries.'
