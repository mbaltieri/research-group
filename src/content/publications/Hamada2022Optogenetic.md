abstract: Serotonin is a neuromodulator that affects multiple behavioral and cognitive
  functions. Nonetheless, how serotonin causes such a variety of effects through its
  brain-wide projections and variety of receptors remains unclear. Here we measured
  the brain-wide response to optogenetic stimulation of serotonin neurons in the dorsal
  raphe nucleus (DRN) by functional MRI using an 11.7T scanner with a cryoprobe. Transient
  activation of DRN serotonin neurons caused wide-spread activation of reward-related
  brain areas. The same stimulation under anesthesia with isoflurane decreased activation
  of those reward-related areas and the hippocampal complex. These brain-wide response
  patterns can be explained by DRN serotonergic projection topography and serotonin
  receptor expression profiles, with enhanced weights on 5-HT1 type receptors. The
  primarily facilitatory effect on reward-related brain areas by DRN serotonergic
  activation is consistent with recent discoveries of its roles in reward-oriented
  behaviors and demands reconsideration of inhibitory view due to the result under
  anesthesia.
