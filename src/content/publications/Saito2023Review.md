abstract: 'Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) enable direct communication between the
  brain and a computer or other external devices.

  They can extend a person’s degree of freedom by either strengthening or substituting
  the human peripheral working capacity.

  Moreover, their potential clinical applications in medical fields include rehabilitation,
  affective computing, communication, and

  control. Over the last decade, noninvasive BCI systems such as electroencephalogram
  (EEG) have progressed from simple

  statistical models to deep learning models, with performance improvement over time
  and enhanced computational power.

  However, numerous challenges pertaining to the clinical use of BCI systems remain,
  e.g., the lack of sufficient data to learn more

  possible features for robust and reliable classification. However, compared with
  fields such as computer vision and speech

  recognition, the training samples in the medical BCI field are limited as they target
  patients who face difficulty generating EEG

  data compared with healthy control. Because deep learning models incorporate several
  parameters, they require considerably

  more data than other conventional methods. Thus, deep learning models have not been
  thoroughly leveraged in medical BCI.

  This study summarizes the state-of-the-art progress of the BCI system over the last
  decade, highlighting critical challenges

  and solutions.'
