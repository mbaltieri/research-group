abstract: Trust attitude is a social personality trait linked with the estimation
  of others’ trustworthiness. Trusting others, however, can have substantial negative
  effects on mental health, such as the development of depression. Despite significant
  progress in understanding the neurobiology of trust, whether the neuroanatomy of
  trust is linked with depression vulnerability remains unknown. To investigate a
  link between the neuroanatomy of trust and depression vulnerability, we assessed
  trust and depressive symptoms and employed neuroimaging to acquire brain structure
  data of healthy participants. A high depressive symptom score was used as an indicator
  of depression vulnerability. The neuroanatomical results observed with the healthy
  sample were validated in a sample of clinically diagnosed depressive patients. We
  found significantly higher depressive symptoms among low trusters than among high
  trusters. Neuroanatomically, low trusters and depressive patients showed similar
  volume reduction in brain regions implicated in social cognition, including the
  dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), dorsomedial PFC, posterior cingulate, precuneus,
  and angular gyrus. Furthermore, the reduced volume of the DLPFC and precuneus mediated
  the relationship between trust and depressive symptoms. These findings contribute
  to understanding social- and neural-markers of depression vulnerability and may
  inform the development of social interventions to prevent pathological depression.
