abstract: Temperature constraints are highly desirable in the experimental setup when
  seeking the synthesis of new carbon structures. Fluctuations of the Dirac field
  result in temperature-dependent corrections to the Helfrich-Canham formulation,
  which governs the classical elasticity of the membrane in equilibrium state. Here,
  we examine the emergent shapes allowed by the effective model up to quadratic order
  in Ricci curvature and discuss the constraints required to observe them. We determine
  the mechanical stability conditions and provide a phase diagram characterized by
  the appearance of a critical temperature Tc that distinguishes between carbon nanotube
  and fullerene phases. The observation of minimal and developable surfaces is anticipated,
  respectively, at the high- and low-temperature regimes.
