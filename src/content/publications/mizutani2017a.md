abstract: We present an asymptotic criterion to determine the optimal number of clusters
  in k-means. We consider k-means as data compression, and propose to adopt the number
  of clusters that minimizes the estimated description length after compression. Here
  we report two types of compression ratio based on two ways to quantify the description
  length of data after compression. This approach further offers a way to evaluate
  whether clusters obtained with k-means have a hierarchical structure by examining
  whether multi-stage compression can further reduce the description length. We applied
  our criteria to determine the number of clusters to synthetic data and empirical
  neuroimaging data to observe the behavior of the criteria across different types
  of data set and suitability of the two types of criteria for different datasets.
  We found that our method can offer reasonable clustering results that are useful
  for dimension reduction. While our numerical results revealed dependency of our
  criteria on the various aspects of dataset such as the dimensionality, the description
  length approach proposed here provides a useful guidance to determine the number
  of clusters in a principled manner when underlying properties of the data are unknown
  and only inferred from observation of data.
