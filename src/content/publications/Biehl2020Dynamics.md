abstract: The free energy principle which underlies active inference attempts to explain
  the emergence of Bayesian inference in stochastic processes under the assumption
  of (non-equilibrium) steady state distributions. We contribute a study of the dynamics
  of an exact Bayesian inference hyperparameter embedded in a Markov chain that infers
  the dynamics of an observed process. This system does not have a steady-state but
  still contains exact Bayesian inference. Our study may contribute to future generalizations
  of the free energy principle to non-steady state systems. Our treatment uses well-known
  constructions in Bayesian inference. The main contribution is that we take a different
  perspective than that of standard treatments. We are interested in how the dynamics
  of Bayesian inference look from the outside.
