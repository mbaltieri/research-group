abstract: The process of reconstructing experiences from human brain activity offers
  a unique lens into how the brain interprets and represents the world. In this paper,
  we introduce a method for reconstructing music from brain activity, captured using
  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Our approach uses either music retrieval
  or the MusicLM music generation model conditioned on embeddings derived from fMRI
  data. The generated music resembles the musical stimuli that human subjects experienced,
  with respect to semantic properties like genre, instrumentation, and mood. We investigate
  the relationship between different components of MusicLM and brain activity through
  a voxel-wise encoding modeling analysis. Furthermore, we discuss which brain regions
  represent information derived from purely textual descriptions of music stimuli.
