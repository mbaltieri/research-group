abstract: To understand the nature of the complex behavior of the brain, one important
  step is to identify “cores” in the brain network, where neurons or brain areas strongly
  interact with each other. Cores can be considered as essential sub-networks for
  brain functions. In the last few decades, an information-theoretic approach to identifying
  cores has been developed. In this approach, many-to-many nonlinear interactions
  between parts are measured by an information loss function, which quantifies how
  much information would be lost if interactions between parts were removed. Then,
  a core called a “complex” is defined as a subsystem wherein the amount of information
  loss is locally maximal. Although identifying complexes can be a novel and useful
  approach to revealing essential properties of the brain network, its practical application
  is hindered by the fact that computation time grows exponentially with system size.
  Here we propose a fast and exact algorithm for finding complexes, called Hierarchical
  Partitioning for Complex search (HPC). HPC finds complexes by hierarchically partitioning
  systems to narrow down candidates for complexes. The computation time of HPC is
  polynomial, which is dramatically smaller than exponential. We prove that HPC is
  exact when an information loss function satisfies a mathematical property, monotonicity.
  We show that mutual information is one such information loss function. We also show
  that a broad class of submodular functions can be considered as such information
  loss functions, indicating the expandability of our framework to the class. In simulations,
  we show that HPC can find complexes in large systems (up to several hundred) in
  a practical amount of time when mutual information is used as an information loss
  function. Finally, we demonstrate the use of HPC in electrocorticogram recordings
  from monkeys. HPC revealed temporally stable and characteristic complexes, indicating
  that it can be reliably utilized to characterize brain networks.
