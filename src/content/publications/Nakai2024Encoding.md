abstract: Cognitive computational neuroscience has received broad attention in recent
  years as an emerging area integrating cognitive science, neuroscience, and artificial
  intelligence. At the heart of this field, approaches using encoding models allow
  for explaining brain activity from latent and high-dimensional features, including
  artificial neural networks. With the notable exception of temporal response function
  models that are applied to electroencephalography, most prior studies have focused
  on adult subjects, making it difficult to capture how brain representations change
  with learning and development. Here, we argue that future developmental cognitive
  neuroscience studies would benefit from approaches relying on encoding models. We
  provide an overview of encoding models used in adult functional magnetic resonance
  imaging research. This research has notably used data with a small number of subjects,
  but with a large number of samples per subject. Studies using encoding models also
  generally require task-based neuroimaging data. Though these represent challenges
  for developmental studies, we argue that these challenges may be overcome by using
  functional alignment techniques and naturalistic paradigms. These methods would
  facilitate encoding model analysis in developmental neuroimaging research, which
  may lead to important theoretical advances.
