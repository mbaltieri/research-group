abstract: Quantifying brain state transition cost is a fundamental problem in systems
  neuroscience. Previous studies utilized network control theory to measure the cost
  by considering a neural system as a deterministic dynamical system. However, this
  approach does not capture the stochasticity of neural systems, which is important
  for accurately quantifying brain state transition cost. Here, we propose a novel
  framework based on optimal control in stochastic systems. In our framework, we quantify
  the transition cost as the Kullback-Leibler divergence from an uncontrolled transition
  path to the optimally controlled path, which is known as Schrödinger’s bridge. To
  test its utility, we applied this framework to functional magnetic resonance imaging
  data from the Human Connectome Project and computed the brain state transition cost
  in cognitive tasks. We demonstrate correspondence between brain state transition
  cost and the difficulty of tasks. The results suggest that our framework provides
  a general theoretical tool for investigating cognitive functions from the viewpoint
  of transition cost.
