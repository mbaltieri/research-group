abstract: Childhood abuse reduces hippocampal and amygdala volumes and impairs social
  cognition, including the ability to recognize facial expressions. However, these
  associations have been studied primarily in individuals with a history of severe
  abuse and psychiatric symptoms; researchers have not determined whether these associations
  can also be observed in healthy adults. In the present study, we analyzed data from
  400 healthy adults (208 men and 192 women) at Tamagawa University. Parental rejection
  reflecting childhood abuse was assessed using the short form of Egna Minnen Beträffande
  Uppfostran, while social cognition was assessed using the “Fake Smile Detection
  Task.” Hippocampal and amygdala volumes were extracted from T1-weighted magnetic
  resonance imaging data using FreeSurfer. We found that greater parental rejection
  resulted in smaller hippocampal and amygdala volumes and poorer performance in the
  Fake Smile Detection Task. Structural equation modeling analysis supported the model
  that hippocampal volume mediates maternal rejection effect on performance on the
  Fake Smile Detection Task, with involvement of the amygdala. These findings are
  in line with the structural and functional connectivity found between the hippocampus
  and amygdala and their joint involvement in social cognition. Therefore, parental
  rejection may affect hippocampal and amygdala volumes and social cognitive function
  even in symptom-free adults.
