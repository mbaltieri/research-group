abstract: 'The free energy principle, an influential framework in computational neuroscience
  and theoretical neurobiology, starts from the assumption that living systems ensure
  adaptive exchanges with their environment by minimizing the objective function of
  variational free energy. Following this premise, it claims to deliver a promising
  integration of the life sciences. In recent work, Markov Blankets, one of the central
  constructs of the free energy principle, have been applied to resolve debates central
  to philosophy (such as demarcating the boundaries of the mind). The aim of this
  paper is twofold. First, we trace the development of Markov blankets starting from
  their standard application in Bayesian networks, via variational inference, to their
  use in the literature on active inference. We then identify a persistent confusion
  in the literature between the formal use of Markov blankets as an epistemic tool
  for Bayesian inference, and their novel metaphysical use in the free energy framework
  to demarcate the physical boundary between an agent and its environment. Consequently,
  we propose to distinguish between ‘Pearl blankets’ to refer to the original epistemic
  use of Markov blankets and ‘Friston blankets’ to refer to the new metaphysical construct.
  Second, we use this distinction to critically assess claims resting on the application
  of Markov blankets to philosophical problems. We suggest that this literature would
  do well in differentiating between two different research programs: ‘inference with
  a model’ and ‘inference within a model’. Only the latter is capable of doing metaphysical
  work with Markov blankets, but requires additional philosophical premises and cannot
  be justified by an appeal to the success of the mathematical framework alone.'
