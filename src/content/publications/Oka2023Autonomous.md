abstract: Scientists write research articles, process ethics reviews, evaluate proposals
  and research, and seek funding. Several strategies have been proposed to optimize
  these operations and to decentralize access to research resources and opportunities.
  For instance, we previously proposed the trinity review method, combining registered
  reports with financing and research ethics assessments. However, previously proposed
  systems have a number of shortcomings, including how to implement them, e.g., who
  manages them, how incentives for reviewers are paid, etc. Various solutions have
  been proposed to address these issues, employing methods based on blockchain technologies,
  called “decentralized science (DeSci)”. Decentralized approaches that exploit these
  developments offer potentially profound improvements to the troubled scientific
  ecosystem. Here, we propose a system that integrates ethics reviews, peer reviews,
  and funding in a decentralized manner, based on Web3 technology. This new method,
  named ABCDEF publishing, would enhance the speed, fairness, and transparency of
  scientific research and publishing.
