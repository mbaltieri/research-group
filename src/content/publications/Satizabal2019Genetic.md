abstract: Subcortical brain structures are integral to motion, consciousness, emotions
  and learning. We identified common genetic variation related to the volumes of the
  nucleus accumbens, amygdala, brainstem, caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, putamen
  and thalamus, using genome-wide association analyses in almost 40,000 individuals
  from CHARGE, ENIGMA and UK Biobank. We show that variability in subcortical volumes
  is heritable, and identify 48 significantly associated loci (40 novel at the time
  of analysis). Annotation of these loci by utilizing gene expression, methylation
  and neuropathological data identified 199 genes putatively implicated in neurodevelopment,
  synaptic signaling, axonal transport, apoptosis, inflammation/infection and susceptibility
  to neurological disorders. This set of genes is significantly enriched for Drosophila
  orthologs associated with neurodevelopmental phenotypes, suggesting evolutionarily
  conserved mechanisms. Our findings uncover novel biology and potential drug targets
  underlying brain development and disease.
