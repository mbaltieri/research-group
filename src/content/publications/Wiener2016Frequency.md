abstract: The perception of time and prediction of upcoming events requires coordination
  between a diverse set of neural regions. Neural oscillations have emerged as a candidate
  mechanism for neural timing; however, no single frequency has yet emerged as dominant
  for timing and action. We suggest that different frequency bands may be associated
  with different neural networks that are context-dependent, such that they are only
  invoked when a particular task context is encountered. To determine the connection
  between observed oscillations and these neural networks, causal methods are necessary
  to disrupt oscillatory activity and measure resultant changes in neural network
  activity.
