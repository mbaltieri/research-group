abstract: 'The subjective features of psychological phenomena have been studied intensively
  in experimental science in recent years. Although various methods have been proposed
  to identify subjective features of psychological phenomena, there are elusive subjective
  features such as the spatiotemporal structure of experience, which are difficult
  to capture without some additional methodological tools. We propose a new experimental
  method to address this challenge, which we call the contrast-based experimental
  phenomenological method (CEP). CEP proceeds in four steps: (i) front-loading phenomenology,
  (ii) online second-personal interview, (iii) questionnaire survey, and (iv) hypotheses
  testing. It differs from other experimental phenomenological methods in that it
  takes advantage of phenomenal contrasts in collecting phenomenological data. In
  this paper, we verify the validity and productivity of this method by applying it
  to binocular rivalry (BR). The study contributes to empirical research on BR in
  three respects. First, it provides additional evidence for existing propositions
  about the subjective features of BR: e.g. the proposition that the temporal dynamics
  of the experience depend upon subject-dependent parameters such as attentional change.
  Second, it deepens our understanding of the spatiotemporal structures of the transition
  phase of BR. Third, it elicits new research questions about depth experience and
  individual differences in BR. The presence of such contributions demonstrates the
  validity and productivity of CEP.'
