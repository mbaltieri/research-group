abstract: Logical reasoning is essential in a variety of human activities. A representative
  example of a logical task is mathematics. Recent large-scale models trained on large
  datasets have been successful in various fields, but their reasoning ability in
  arithmetic tasks is limited, which we reproduce experimentally. Here, we recast
  this limitation as not unique to mathematics but common to tasks that require logical
  operations. We then propose a new set of tasks, termed logical tasks, which will
  be the next challenge to address. This higher point of view helps the development
  of inductive biases that have broad impact beyond the solution of individual tasks.
  We define and characterize logical tasks and discuss system requirements for their
  solution. Furthermore, we discuss the relevance of logical tasks to concepts such
  as extrapolation, explainability, and inductive bias. Finally, we provide directions
  for solving logical tasks.
