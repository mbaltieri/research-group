abstract: Second language (L2) comprehension is thought to proceed hierarchically,
  from basic word recognition to complex discourse-level understanding. However, the
  neural mechanisms underpinning this hierarchical progression remain poorly understood.
  Leveraging the hierarchical nature of linguistic representations in large language
  models (LLMs), we investigated whether L2 proficiency modulates brain-LLM alignment
  in a layer-dependent manner. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
  data collected during discourse listening from 54 participants with varying levels
  of L2 proficiency, we constructed individualized encoding models to quantify how
  proficiency shapes the brain-LLM representational correspondence. In high-proficiency
  individuals, LLM-based models reliably predicted neural responses in a distributed
  network comprising temporal, frontal, and medial-parietal cortices, while for low-proficiency
  participants, prediction performance decreased. Notably, alignment in the superior
  temporal sulcus (STS) showed a robust correlation with L2 proficiency at mid-to-deep
  LLM layers, suggesting that the STS encodes higher-level linguistic abstractions
  essential for advanced language comprehension. These findings indicate that L2 proficiency
  modulates the hierarchical alignment between LLMs and the brain, providing insights
  into how L2 learning shapes neural language representations.
