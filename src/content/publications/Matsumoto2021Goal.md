abstract: 'The existing goal-directed planning methods using predictive-coding-based
  variational recurrent neural network (PV-RNN) need many training samples. In this
  study, we propose a goal-directed planning method by PV-RNN from small training
  samples. To achieve generalization from small training samples, the proposed PV-RNN
  integrates the following two ideas: (1) To have internal models based on kinematics
  or dynamics (2) To have diversity in small training samples. We evaluated our proposed
  PV-RNN model for its ability to generate sufficiently generalized goal-directed
  plans from small training samples using an 8-DOF robot arm in a simulator environment.
  Furthermore, we evaluated the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed PV-RNN
  compared to general reinforcement learning and imitation learning using a benchmark
  environment for a robot arm task.'
