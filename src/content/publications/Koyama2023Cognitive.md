abstract: Functional MRI (fMRI) has been instrumental in understanding how cognitive
  processes are spatially mapped in the brain, yielding insights about brain regions
  and functions. However, in case the orthogonality of behavioral or stimulus timing
  is not guaranteed, the estimated brain maps fail to dissociate each cognitive process,
  and the resultant maps become unstable. Also, the brain mapping exercise can not
  provide temporal information on the cognitive process. Here we propose a qualitatively
  different approach to fMRI analysis, named Cognitive Dynamics Estimation (CDE),
  that estimates how multiple cognitive processes change over time even when behavior
  or stimulus logs are unavailable. This method transposes the conventional brain
  mapping; the brain activity pattern at each time point is subject to regression
  analysis with data-driven maps of cognitive processes as regressors, resulting in
  the time series of cognitive processes. The estimated time series captured the fluctuation
  of intensity and timing of cognitive processes on a trial-by-trial basis, which
  conventional analysis could not capture. Notably, the estimated time series predicted
  participants’ cognitive ability to perform each psychological task. As an addition
  to our fMRI analytic toolkit, these results suggest the potential for CDE to elucidate
  underexplored cognitive phenomena, especially in the temporal domain.
