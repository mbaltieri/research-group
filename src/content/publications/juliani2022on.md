abstract: 'In popular media, there is often a connection drawn between the advent
  of awareness in artificial agents and those same agents simultaneously achieving
  human or superhuman level intelligence. In this work, we explore the validity and
  potential application of this seemingly intuitive link between consciousness and
  intelligence. We do so by examining the cognitive abilities associated with three
  contemporary theories of conscious function: Global Workspace Theory (GWT), Information
  Generation Theory (IGT), and Attention Schema Theory (AST). We find that all three
  theories specifically relate conscious function to some aspect of domain-general
  intelligence in humans. With this insight, we turn to the field of Artificial Intelligence
  (AI) and find that, while still far from demonstrating general intelligence, many
  state-of-the-art deep learning methods have begun to incorporate key aspects of
  each of the three functional theories. Given this apparent trend, we use the motivating
  example of mental time travel in humans to propose ways in which insights from each
  of the three theories may be combined into a unified model. We believe that doing
  so can enable the development of artificial agents which are not only more generally
  intelligent but are also consistent with multiple current theories of conscious
  function.'
