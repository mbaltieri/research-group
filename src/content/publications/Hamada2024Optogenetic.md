abstract: Serotonin is a neuromodulator that affects multiple behavioral and cognitive
  functions. Nonetheless, how serotonin causes such a variety of effects via brain-wide
  projections and various receptors remains unclear. Here we measured brain-wide responses
  to optogenetic stimulation of serotonin neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN)
  of the male mouse brain using functional MRI with an 11.7 T scanner and a cryoprobe.
  Transient activation of DRN serotonin neurons caused brain-wide activation, including
  the medial prefrontal cortex, the striatum, and the ventral tegmental area. The
  same stimulation under anesthesia with isoflurane decreased brain-wide activation,
  including the hippocampal complex. These brain-wide response patterns can be explained
  by DRN serotonergic projection topography and serotonin receptor expression profiles,
  with enhanced weights on 5-HT1 receptors. Together, these results provide insight
  into the DR serotonergic system, which is consistent with recent discoveries of
  its functions in adaptive behaviors.
