abstract: The recent link discovered between generalized Legendre transforms and non-dually
  flat statistical manifolds suggests a fundamental reason behind the ubiquity of
  Rényi’s divergence and entropy in a wide range of physical phenomena. However, these
  early findings still provide little intuition on the nature of this relationship
  and its implications for physical systems. Here we shed new light on the Legendre
  transform by revealing the consequences of its deformation via symplectic geometry
  and complexification. These findings reveal a novel common framework that leads
  to a principled and unified understanding of physical systems that are not well-described
  by classic information-theoretic quantities.
