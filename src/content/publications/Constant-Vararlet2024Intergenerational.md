abstract: 'Children often show cognitive and affective traits that are similar to
  their parents. Although this indicates a transmission of phenotypes from parents
  to children, little is known about the neural underpinnings of that transmission.
  Here, we provide a general overview of neuroimaging studies that explore the similarity
  between parents and children in terms of brain structure and function. We notably
  discuss the aims, designs, and methods of these so-called intergenerational neuroimaging
  studies, focusing on two main designs: the parent-child design and the multigenerational
  design. For each design, we also summarize the major findings, identify the sources
  of variability between studies, and highlight some limitations and future directions.
  We argue that the lack of consensus in defining the parent-child transmission of
  brain structure and function leads to measurement heterogeneity, which is a challenge
  for future studies. Additionally, multigenerational studies often use measures of
  family resemblance to estimate the proportion of variance attributed to genetic
  versus environmental factors, though this estimate is likely inflated given the
  frequent lack of control for shared environment. Nonetheless, intergenerational
  neuroimaging studies may still have both clinical and theoretical relevance, not
  because they currently inform about the etiology of neuromarkers, but rather because
  they may help identify neuromarkers and test hypotheses about neuromarkers coming
  from more standard neuroimaging designs.'
