abstract: In mixed-initiative cocreation tasks, wherein a human and a machine jointly
  create items, it is important to provide multiple relevant suggestions to the designer.
  Quality-diversity algorithms are commonly used for this purpose, as they can provide
  diverse suggestions that represent salient areas of the solution space, showcasing
  designs with high fitness and wide variety. Because generated suggestions drive
  the search process, it is important that they provide inspiration, but also stay
  aligned with the designer's intentions. Additionally, often many interactions with
  the system are required before the designer is content with a solution. In this
  article, we tackle these challenges with an interactive constrained multidimensional
  archive of phenotypic-elites system that leverages emitters to learn the preferences
  of the designer, and then, use them in automated steps. By learning preferences,
  the generated designs remain aligned with the designer's intent, and by applying
  automatic steps, we generate more solutions per user interaction, giving a larger
  number of choices to the designer, and thereby, speeding up the search. We propose
  a general framework for preference-learning emitters and apply it to a procedural
  content generation task in the video game Space Engineers . We built an interactive
  application for our algorithm and performed a user study with players.
