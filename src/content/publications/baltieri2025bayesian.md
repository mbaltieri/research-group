abstract: The internal model principle, originally proposed in the theory of control
  of linear systems, nowadays represents a more general class of results in control
  theory and cybernetics. The central claim of these results is that, under suitable
  assumptions, if a system (a controller) can regulate against a class of external
  inputs (from the environment), it is because the system contains a model of the
  system causing these inputs, which can be used to generate signals counteracting
  them. Similar claims on the role of internal models appear also in cognitive science,
  especially in modern Bayesian treatments of cognitive agents, often suggesting that
  a system (a human subject, or some other agent) models its environment to adapt
  against disturbances and perform goal-directed behaviour. It is however unclear
  whether the Bayesian internal models discussed in cognitive science bear any formal
  relation to the internal models invoked in standard treatments of control theory.
  Here, we first review the internal model principle and present a precise formulation
  of it using concepts inspired by categorical systems theory. This leads to a formal
  definition of `model' generalising its use in the internal model principle. Although
  this notion of model is not a priori related to the notion of Bayesian reasoning,
  we show that it can be seen as a special case of possibilistic Bayesian filtering.
  This result is based on a recent line of work formalising, using Markov categories,
  a notion of `interpretation', describing when a system can be interpreted as performing
  Bayesian filtering on an outside world in a consistent way.
