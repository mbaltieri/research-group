abstract: The potential of using neural data to predict academic outcomes has always
  been at the heart of educational neuroscience, an emerging field at the crossroad
  of psychology, neuroscience and education sciences. Although this prospect has long
  been elusive, the exponential useof advanced techniques in machine learningand artificial
  intelligencein neuroimaging may change this state of affairs. Here we provide areview
  ofneuroimaging studies that have used machine learning to predict literacy and numeracy
  outcomes in adults and children, both in the context of learning disability and
  typical performance. We notably review the cross-sectional and longitudinal designs
  used in such studies, anddescribe how they can be coupled with regression and classification
  approaches. Our review highlightsthe promise of these methodsfor predicting literacy
  and numeracy outcomes (and difficulties). However,we also found a large variability
  in terms of algorithms and underlying brain circuitsacrossstudies, and a relative
  lack of studies investigating longitudinal prediction of outcomes in young children
  before the onset of formal education.This calls for a standardization of methods
  in the field, as well as for a greateruse ofaccessible and portable neuroimaging
  methods that have more applicability potential than lab-based neuroimaging techniques.
