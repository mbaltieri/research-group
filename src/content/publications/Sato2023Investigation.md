abstract: 'Recent advances in non-invasive brain function measurement

  technologies, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and

  magnetoencephalography (MEG), and the development of machine learning techniques,
  including deep learning, have led to increased research

  on the elucidation and quantitative understanding of information processing processes
  in the human brain. Since the emergence of word2vec,

  which represents the meaning of natural language words as vectors, features of language
  stimuli given to the human brain have been represented

  using large language models in natural language processing and used to

  estimate brain states. In this study, we used GPT-2, which is known to

  perform well as a feature for predicting brain states, and investigated

  the information processing processes in the human brain when reading

  Japanese short poems, i.e., tanka poetry. In particular, we investigated

  the hubness of the regions of interest in the brain by applying the PageRank algorithm.
  As a result, we have found that the cingulate cortex and

  the insula, which are said to be related to emotion, have hubness in brain

  regions, while occipital lobe, which are not said to be related to emotion,

  have also hubness.'
