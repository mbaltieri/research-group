abstract: 'Recent advances in robot learning have shown

  promise in achieving multitask control and generalisation to

  novel scenarios—a feat previously difficult to achieve with hand-

  engineered solutions. However, these results are not as grandiose

  as those achieved by large models trained on internet-scale data;

  robot learning is still crucially limited by the bottleneck of real-

  world data collection. To breach this gap, we propose a data

  augmentation framework that utilises several large pretrained

  models to generate additional data from a limited set of human

  demonstrations. By combining pretrained image segmentation,

  image inpainting and depth estimation models, we can create

  new scenarios that are not seen in the dataset, but that are

  still consistent with the task setup. We demonstrate zero-shot

  capacity on a real robot, by training an agent on our augmented

  dataset to successfully manipulate objects that did not exist in

  the original collected data.'
