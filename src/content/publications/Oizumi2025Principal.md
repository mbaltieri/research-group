abstract: 'Qualia, the subjective qualities of experience, pose a fundamental challenge
  to scientific explanation. A promising recent approach is to characterize qualia
  by their relational structures rather than their intrinsic nature. Assuming the
  structure of qualia is characterized by the geometry of neural representations,
  we posit that this geometry is fundamentally organized by symmetry.  We propose
  that the principal bundle, induced by a symmetry group G acting on a neural network’s
  state space, is the essential mathematical object that provides a complete and rigorous
  characterization of this geometric structure. The core mathematical principle is
  that, for a G-equivariant network, its state space partitions into a quotient space
  Q and orbits induced by the group G. This framework reveals a three-level hierarchy
  for characterizing qualia. First, the choice of the symmetry group G itself defines
  the fundamental nature of the qualia modality (e.g., vision versus audition).  Second,
  we identify a qualia signature with a point in the quotient space Q (e.g., perceiving
  the signature “cat”), representing the invariant identity of a percept.  Third,
  we identify a qualia attribute with a position on a specific orbit (e.g., the cat’s
  location), representing its continuous variations.  This framework uncovers a powerful
  duality:  the geometry of the orbits is rigid, inheriting the structure of the group
  G, which explains the stable relational structure of qualia attributes. In contrast,
  the geometry of the quotient space is plastic, allowing the relationships between
  qualia signatures to be shaped by learning.  This geometric hierarchy provides a
  unified language for explaining the structure of perceptual experience. Furthermore,
  our framework generates empirical predictions and a clear research strategy for
  characterizing qualia, offering a path to a deeper scientific understanding of subjective
  experience.'
