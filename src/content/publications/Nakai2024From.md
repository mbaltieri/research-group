abstract: The potential of using neural data to predict academic outcomes has always
  been at the heart of educational neuroscience, an emerging field at the crossroad
  of psychology, neuroscience, and education sciences. Although this prospect has
  long been elusive, the exponential use of advanced techniques in machine learning
  in neuroimaging may change this state of affairs. Here we provide a review of neuroimaging
  studies that have used machine learning to predict literacy and numeracy outcomes
  in adults and children, in both the context of learning disability and typical performance.
  We notably review the cross-sectional and longitudinal designs used in such studies,
  and describe how they can be coupled with regression and classification approaches.
  Our review highlights the promise of these methods for predicting literacy and numeracy
  outcomes, as well as their difficulties. However, we also found a large variability
  in terms of algorithms and underlying brain circuits across studies, and a relative
  lack of studies investigating longitudinal prediction of outcomes in young children
  before the onset of formal education. We argue that the field needs a standardization
  of methods, as well as a greater use of accessible and portable neuroimaging methods
  that have more applicability potential than lab-based neuroimaging techniques.
