abstract: Predictive processing and active inference posit that the brain is a system
  performing Bayesian inference on the environment. By virtue of this, a prominent
  interpretation of predictive processing states that the generative model (a POMDP)
  encoded by the brain synchronises with the generative process (another POMDP) representing
  the environment while trying to explain what hidden properties of the world generated
  its sensory input. In this view, the brain is thought to become a copy of the environment.
  This claim has however been disputed, stressing the fact that a structural copy,
  or isomorphism as it is at times invoked to be, is not an accurate description of
  this process since the environment is necessarily more complex than the brain, and
  what matters is not the capacity to exactly recapitulate the veridical causal structure
  of the world. In this work, we make parts of this counterargument formal by using
  ideas from the theory of coalgebras, an abstract mathematical framework for dynamical
  systems that brings together work from automata theory, concurrency theory, probabilistic
  processes and other fields. To do so, we cast generative model and process, in the
  form of POMDPs, as coalgebras, and use maps between them to describe a form of consistency
  that goes beyond mere structural similarity, giving the necessary mathematical background
  to describe how different processes can be seen as behaviourally, rather than structurally,
  equivalent, i.e. how they can be seen as emitting the same observations, and thus
  minimise prediction error, over time without strict assumptions about structural
  similarity. In particular, we will introduce three standard notions of equivalence
  from the literature on coalgebras, evaluating them in the context of predictive
  processing and identifying the one closest to claims made by proponents of this
  framework.
