abstract: The introduction of the generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL)
  algorithm has spurred the development of scalable imitation learning approaches
  using deep neural networks. The GAIL objective can be thought of as 1) matching
  the expert policy's state distribution; 2) penalising the learned policy's state
  distribution; and 3) maximising entropy. While theoretically motivated, in practice
  GAIL can be difficult to apply, not least due to the instabilities of adversarial
  training. In this paper, we take a pragmatic look at GAIL and related imitation
  learning algorithms. We implement and automatically tune a range of algorithms in
  a unified experimental setup, presenting a fair evaluation between the competing
  methods. From our results, our primary recommendation is to consider non-adversarial
  methods. Furthermore, we discuss the common components of imitation learning objectives,
  and present promising avenues for future research.
