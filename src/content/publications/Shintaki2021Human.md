abstract: 'Foraging is a fundamental food-seeking behavior in a wide range of species
  that enables survival in an uncertain world. During foraging, behavioral agents
  constantly face a trade-off between staying in their current location or exploring
  another. Despite ethological generality and importance of foraging, it remains unclear
  how the human brain guides continuous decision in such situations. Here we show
  that anticipatory activity dynamics in the anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC) and
  hippocampus underpin foraging for primary rewards. While functional MRI was performed,
  humans foraged for real liquid rewards available after tens of seconds, and continuous
  decision during foraging was tracked by a dynamic pattern of brain activity that
  reflected anticipation of a future reward. When the dynamic anticipatory activity
  in the aPFC was enhanced, humans remained in their current environment, but when
  this activity diminished, they explored a new environment. Moreover, the anticipatory
  activity in the aPFC and hippocampus was associated with distinct decision strategies:
  aPFC activity was enhanced in humans adopting an exploratory strategy, whereas those
  remaining stationary showed enhanced activity in the hippocampus. Our results suggest
  that anticipatory dynamics in the fronto-hippocampal mechanisms underlie continuous
  decision-making during human foraging.'
