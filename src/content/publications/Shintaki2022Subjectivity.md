abstract: Our preference for a reward depends on the time of delay for its delivery.
  Here we show that changes in the external environment can manipulate the perceived
  duration of time, which alters the formation of the choice preference through value
  signals in the cortical and subcortical brain regions. Humans anticipated a real
  liquid reward delayed by tens of seconds, during which colors of visually presented
  panels gradually changed. The color-change delay was perceived as shorter than a
  control color-constant delay. Interestingly, participants with greater perceptual
  bias of the delay showed stronger preference for rewards with the color-change delay.
  The ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) and ventral striatum (VS) showed dynamic
  neural signatures of value components that were modulated by subjectively perceived
  duration. Crucially, these effects were specifically observed while a future reward
  was anticipated, and moreover, the vlPFC activity was weaker in participants with
  greater bias in the duration perception. These results demonstrate that subjective
  time experience leads to biased choice preference of delayed rewards, which is regulated
  by dynamic value signals of future rewards and accurate perception of the external
  world in the vlPFC-VS systems.
