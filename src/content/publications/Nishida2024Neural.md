abstract: Phenomenology is one of the most promising approaches to study conscious
  experience. It holds that a rigorous study of conscious experience requires a transition
  in the subject from the "natural attitude" (NA) to the "phenomenological attitude"
  (PA). NA describes our ordinary stance, in which our attention is directed at external
  objects and events. PA is a distinctive, reflective stance in which our attention
  is directed at our conscious experience itself. Despite its theoretical importance
  in philosophy and science of consciousness, the neural mechanisms underlying PA
  remain unknown. To clarify this point, we developed a novel behavioral task in which
  participants alternate between NA and PA in relation to their stimulus-evoked subjective
  experiences. Participants are presented with two sentences and requested to identify
  the one that best captures their experience. These sentences are designed to induce
  either NA or PA. We found that participants had lower error rates but slower reaction
  times in the PA condition compared to the NA condition, suggesting a difference
  beyond task difficulty. Using fMRI, we also found that multivoxel activation patterns
  in the premotor cortex, posterior parietal cortex, supplementary motor area, and
  cerebellum successfully classified the task conditions. Furthermore, the activation
  strength in these regions was lower in the PA condition, indicating that PA depends
  on neural processes that suppress action-related information. These findings provide
  the first evidence for the neural signature of PA, contributing to a better understanding
  of phenomenological method and its underlying neural mechanisms.
