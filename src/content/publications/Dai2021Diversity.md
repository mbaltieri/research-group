abstract: Hindsight experience replay (HER) is a goal relabelling technique typically
  used with off-policy deep reinforcement learning algorithms to solve goal-oriented
  tasks; it is well suited to robotic manipulation tasks that deliver only sparse
  rewards. In HER, both trajectories and transitions are sampled uniformly for training.
  However, not all of the agent's experiences contribute equally to training, and
  so naive uniform sampling may lead to inefficient learning. In this paper, we propose
  diversity-based trajectory and goal selection with HER (DTGSH). Firstly, trajectories
  are sampled according to the diversity of the goal states as modelled by determinantal
  point processes (DPPs). Secondly, transitions with diverse goal states are selected
  from the trajectories by using k-DPPs. We evaluate DTGSH on five challenging robotic
  manipulation tasks in simulated robot environments, where we show that our method
  can learn more quickly and reach higher performance than other state-of-the-art
  approaches on all tasks.
