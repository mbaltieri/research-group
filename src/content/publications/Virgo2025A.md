abstract: 'In a classic paper, Conant and Ashby claimed that "every good regulator
  of a system must be a model of that system." Artificial Life has produced many examples
  of systems that perform tasks with apparently no model in sight; these suggest Conant
  and Ashby''s theorem doesn''t easily generalise beyond its restricted setup. Nevertheless,
  here we show that a similar intuition can be fleshed out in a different way: whenever
  an agent is able to perform a regulation task, it is possible for an observer to
  interpret it as having "beliefs" about its environment, which it "updates" in response
  to sensory input. This notion of belief updating provides a notion of model that
  is more sophisticated than Conant and Ashby''s, as well as a theorem that is more
  broadly applicable. However, it necessitates a change in perspective, in that the
  observer plays an essential role in the theory: models are not a mere property of
  the system but are imposed on it from outside. Our theorem holds regardless of whether
  the system is regulating its environment in a classic control theory setup, or whether
  it''s regulating its own internal state; the model is of its environment either
  way. The model might be trivial, however, and this is how the apparent counterexamples
  are resolved.'
