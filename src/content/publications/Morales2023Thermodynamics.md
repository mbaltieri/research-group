abstract: This paper investigates generalized thermodynamic relationships in physical
  systems where relevant macroscopic variables are determined by the exponential Kolmogorov-Nagumo
  average. We show that while the thermodynamic entropy of such systems is naturally
  described by R\'{e}nyi's entropy with parameter γ, an ordinary Boltzmann distribution
  still describes their statistics under equilibrium thermodynamics. Our results show
  that systems described by exponential Kolmogorov-Nagumo averages can be interpreted
  as systems originally in thermal equilibrium with a heat reservoir with inverse
  temperature β that are suddenly quenched to another heat reservoir with inverse
  temperature β' = (1-γ)β. Furthermore, we show the connection with multifractal thermodynamics.
  For the non-equilibrium case, we show that the dynamics of systems described by
  exponential Kolmogorov-Nagumo averages still observe a second law of thermodynamics
  and the H-theorem. We further discuss the applications of stochastic thermodynamics
  in those systems --- namely, the validity of fluctuation theorems --- and the connection
  with thermodynamic length.
