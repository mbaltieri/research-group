abstract: Active inference is an ambitious theory that treats perception, inference,
  and action selection of autonomous agents under the heading of a single principle.
  It suggests biologically plausible explanations for many cognitive phenomena, including
  consciousness. In active inference, action selection is driven by an objective function
  that evaluates possible future actions with respect to current, inferred beliefs
  about the world. Active inference at its core is independent from extrinsic rewards,
  resulting in a high level of robustness across e.g., different environments or agent
  morphologies. In the literature, paradigms that share this independence have been
  summarized under the notion of intrinsic motivations. In general and in contrast
  to active inference, these models of motivation come without a commitment to particular
  inference and action selection mechanisms. In this article, we study if the inference
  and action selection machinery of active inference can also be used by alternatives
  to the originally included intrinsic motivation. The perception-action loop explicitly
  relates inference and action selection to the environment and agent memory, and
  is consequently used as foundation for our analysis. We reconstruct the active inference
  approach, locate the original formulation within, and show how alternative intrinsic
  motivations can be used while keeping many of the original features intact. Furthermore,
  we illustrate the connection to universal reinforcement learning by means of our
  formalism. Active inference research may profit from comparisons of the dynamics
  induced by alternative intrinsic motivations. Research on intrinsic motivations
  may profit from an additional way to implement intrinsically motivated agents that
  also share the biological plausibility of active inference.
