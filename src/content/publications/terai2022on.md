abstract: In this study, we examined the role of shape features on metaphor generation
  for abstract images based on a simulation with a retrained convolutional neural
  network (CNN), which is in turn based on a pretrained CNN model (AlexNet). A computational
  experiment was conducted using three types of object recognition models, including
  a pretrained object recognition model (AlexNet) and recognition models that were
  retrained to recognize more or fewer shape features using edge-detected or blurred
  images from the ILSVRC-2012 dataset. A psychological experiment was conducted to
  collect metaphors that were used to explain the abstract images. The simulation
  results of the models for the abstract images were compared to examine how well
  they predicted the concepts used in the metaphors generated for the abstract images.
  The results of the computational experiment suggest that the model retrained to
  recognize fewer shape features performed best at predicting the generated metaphors.
  However, for some abstract images, the model retrained to recognize more shape features
  performed better. These results suggest that the role of shape features on metaphor
  generation differs depending on the types of abstract images.
