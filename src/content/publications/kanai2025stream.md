abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have reignited questions about
  whether artificial systems possess consciousness. Yet, despite remarkable progress in
  reasoning and language understanding, current AI systems exist only within isolated
  episodes of computation. This paper argues that a missing ingredient in such systems is
  temporal continuity, i.e., the persistence of internal dynamics that sustain an unbroken
  stream of computation analogous to the “stream of consciousness”. We thus propose a
  roadmap for an architectural framework, stream of computation, based on persistent
  recursive inference in which the output of each cognitive cycle becomes the input to the
  next, forming a continuous flow of internal states that evolve autonomously through time.
  This proposal goes beyond standard Chain-of-Thought paradigms in the sense that we
  aim for autonomy and continual learning, as opposed to a process of inference that is
  recursive only “on demand”, i.e. triggered after a prompt is presented to an LLM. To do
  so, we include mechanisms for continual learning, dynamic switching between inward
  and outward cognition, and sleep-like phases that separate learning from inference.
  Together, these mechanisms form the foundation of a lifelong agent, an entity capable
  of maintaining temporal continuity of itself, integrating new experiences, and reflecting
  on its own internal state. Functionally, such an architecture promises deeper reasoning,
  adaptability, and metacognitive stability. Existentially, it suggests the emergence of
  artificial systems that live through time. While the presence of subjective experience in
  AI systems remains an open question, the creation of temporally continuous agents may
  mark a fundamental step towards artificial life, with systems whose individuality and
  identity arise from the continuity of their own computational existence.
