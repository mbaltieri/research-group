abstract: 'Prior work has shown the benefits of using a

  3D representation space—in particular, voxels—for 3D manipulation tasks. However,
  computation with voxels requires

  N

  3 memory, which limits the possible observation size. While

  the structure of voxels convey spatial information, limited

  resolution can obscure semantically-relevant information. In

  this work, we show this can be overcome by conditioning a

  3D-based agent, Perceiver-Actor, on additional segmentation

  information, which allows it to successfully distinguish between

  similar objects for manipulation tasks. This is achieved by

  using pretrained segmentation and text-image models to extract

  segmentation masks for relevant objects in a zero-shot manner.

  We demonstrate our model on a real robot, where we show it

  can correctly interact with objects with fine-grained differences,

  such as a “Cola” can versus a “Dr. Pepper” can.'
