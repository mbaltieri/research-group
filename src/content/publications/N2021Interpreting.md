abstract: A central concept in active inference is that the internal states of a physical
  system parametrise probability measures over states of the external world. These
  can be seen as an agent’s beliefs, expressed as a Bayesian prior or posterior. Here
  we begin the development of a general theory that would tell us when it is appropriate
  to interpret states as representing beliefs in this way. We focus on the case in
  which a system can be interpreted as performing either Bayesian filtering or Bayesian
  inference. We provide formal definitions of what it means for such an interpretation
  to exist, using techniques from category theory.
