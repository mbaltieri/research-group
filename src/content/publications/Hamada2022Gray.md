abstract: A fundamental question in neuroscience pertains to the associations between
  structure and function of the brain. The advent of structural magnetic resonance
  imaging (sMRI) triggered a vast number of studies in multiple fields to identify
  such associations. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and surface-based morphometry (SBM)
  are among the most notable approaches to structural characterization, offering morphometric
  parameters such as brain volume, cortical thickness, and cortical surface area.
  Neuroscientists have quantitatively associated these structural parameters with
  cognitive function measures such as intelligence quotient (IQ), memory, and motor
  control. Despite rigorous efforts on studying such relationships, there is growing
  alarm about the replicability of such morphometric MRI studies. The concerns sparked
  discussion on the causes of low replicability rate such as cognitive bias, inaccurate
  practice of statistical analysis, and the nature of the distinction between exploratory
  and confirmatory research. To counter these issues, pre-registration has been suggested
  as a method to perform transparent and reproducible research. In this article, we
  first offer a tutorial overview of morphometric MRI analyses and summarize available
  toolboxes such as FreeSurfer, FMRIB software library (FSL), and Statistical Parametric
  Mapping toolbox 12 (SPM12). Next, we discuss methodological issues in conducting
  MRI research and summarize counter plans such as pre-registration and data registration.
  In doing so, we hope to help the readers accelerate transparent and reliable structural
  MRI studies.
