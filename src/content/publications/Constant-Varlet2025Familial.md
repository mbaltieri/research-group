abstract: Parental skills are among the most powerful predictors of children’s outcomes.
  While distal genetic and environmental pathways likely contribute to skill transmission
  within families, much less is known about the proximal neural markers that support
  the transmission of cognitive functioning from parents to children. It is also unclear
  whether brain similarity between parents and children predicts similarity in cognitive
  skills. In this study, we used fMRI to measure brain activity associated with mental
  arithmetic—a task for which intergenerational transmission is consistently observed—in
  37 familial dyads of 8-y-old children and their mothers. Regardless of familial
  ties, multivariate searchlight representational similarity analyses revealed remarkable
  adult–child similarity in the neural representations of a signature of arithmetic
  processing, the problem-size effect, within a broad occipito-parieto-frontal system.
  Comparing familial to nonfamilial adult–child dyads, family-specific transmission
  of neural representations was identified in the bilateral anterior insula and left
  precentral gyrus, key regions of the arithmetic processing network. Mother–child
  neural similarity in the insula and precentral gyrus interacted with maternal skillto
  predict mother–child similarity in math and working memory skills, such that neural
  similarity was more positively related to behavioral similarity in dyads with lower-skilled
  than higher-skilled mothers. Therefore, increased parent–child neural similarity
  may particularly predict shared cognitive abilities among dyads where parents experience
  greater difficulties. Our findings demonstrate that task-related intergenerational
  neuroimaging can identify brain regions involved in the intergenerational transmission
  of cognitive skills. They may have relevance for identifying neural markers of learning
  disabilities through familial transmission.
