abstract: Recent work proposes using world models to generate controlled virtual environments
  in which AI agents can be tested before deployment to ensure their reliability and
  safety. However, accurate world models often have high computational demands that
  can severely restrict the scope and depth of such assessments. Inspired by the classic
  `brain in a vat' thought experiment, here we investigate ways of simplifying world
  models that remain agnostic to the AI agent under evaluation. By following principles
  from computational mechanics, our approach reveals a fundamental trade-off in world
  model construction between efficiency and interpretability, demonstrating that no
  single world model can optimise all desirable characteristics. Building on this
  trade-off, we identify procedures to build world models that either minimise memory
  requirements, delineate the boundaries of what is learnable, or allow tracking causes
  of undesirable outcomes. In doing so, this work establishes fundamental limits in
  world modelling, leading to actionable guidelines that inform core design choices
  related to effective agent evaluation.
