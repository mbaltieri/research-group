abstract: 'In recent years, deep learning has steadily improved the state of the art
  in artificial intelligence (AI), but mainly for single, well-defined tasks or challenges.

  Novel advanced neural network architectures, possibly inspired by neuroscience,
  are needed to create more general-purpose AI systems with flexible and robust capabilities.

  The Global Workspace Theory (GWT), introduced over 30 years ago, proposed such an
  architecture; we now consider its implementation in a deep-learning framework.

  The global workspace was primarily designed to account for conscious information
  processing in the human brain, but in principle, its associated functional advantages
  could generalize to artificial systems.

  In turn, considering an artificial global workspace can help constrain neuroscientific
  investigations of brain function and consciousness.

  Recent advances in deep learning have allowed artificial intelligence (AI) to reach
  near human-level performance in many sensory, perceptual, linguistic, and cognitive
  tasks. There is a growing need, however, for novel, brain-inspired cognitive architectures.
  The Global Workspace Theory (GWT) refers to a large-scale system integrating and
  distributing information among networks of specialized modules to create higher-level
  forms of cognition and awareness. We argue that the time is ripe to consider explicit
  implementations of this theory using deep-learning techniques. We propose a roadmap
  based on unsupervised neural translation between multiple latent spaces (neural
  networks trained for distinct tasks, on distinct sensory inputs and/or modalities)
  to create a unique, amodal Global Latent Workspace (GLW). Potential functional advantages
  of GLW are reviewed, along with neuroscientific implications.'
