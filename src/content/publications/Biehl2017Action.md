abstract: This is a contribution to the formalization of the concept of agents in
  multivariate Markov chains. Agents are commonly defined as entities that act, perceive,
  and are goal-directed. In a multivariate Markov chain (e.g. a cellular automaton)
  the transition matrix completely determines the dynamics. This seems to contradict
  the possibility of acting entities within such a system. Here we present definitions
  of actions and perceptions within multivariate Markov chains based on entitysets.
  Entity-sets represent a largely independent choice of a set of spatiotemporal patterns
  that are considered as all the entities within the Markov chain. For example, the
  entityset can be chosen according to operational closure conditions or complete
  specific integration. Importantly, the perceptionaction loop also induces an entity-set
  and is a multivariate Markov chain. We then show that our definition of actions
  leads to non-heteronomy and that of perceptions specialize to the usual concept
  of perception in the perception-action loop.
