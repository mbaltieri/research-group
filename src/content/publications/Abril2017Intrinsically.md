abstract: 'We propose a more practical method to use empowerment as intrinsic reward
  within a reinforcement learning setting when states and actions are continuous.
  Our method builds upon two ideas: i) To take advantage of a new Bellman-like equation
  of empowerment and ii) to simplify the computation of the local rewards by avoiding
  the approximation of complex distributions over continuous states and actions.'
