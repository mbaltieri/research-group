abstract: This paper presents Integrated Information Theory (IIT) 4.0. IIT aims to
  account for the properties of experience in physical (operational) terms. It identifies
  the essential properties of experience (axioms), infers the necessary and sufficient
  properties that its substrate must satisfy (postulates), and expresses them in mathematical
  terms. In principle, the postulates can be applied to any system of units in a state
  to determine whether it is conscious, to what degree, and in what way. IIT offers
  a parsimonious explanation of empirical evidence, makes testable predictions, and
  permits inferences and extrapolations. IIT 4.0 incorporates several developments
  of the past ten years, including a more accurate translation of axioms into postulates
  and mathematical expressions, the introduction of a unique measure of intrinsic
  information that is consistent with the postulates, and an explicit assessment of
  causal relations. By fully unfolding a system's irreducible cause-effect power,
  the distinctions and relations specified by a substrate can account for the quality
  of experience.
