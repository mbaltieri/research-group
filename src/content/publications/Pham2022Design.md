abstract: A functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) compatible haptic interface
  is drawing interest from neuroscientists in recent years. The strong magnetic field
  of the MRI scanner prevents the use of the commercially available tactile display.
  Previous studies showed the potential of pneumatic actuation techniques, limited
  to temporal stimulation. In this study, we proposed a modulated pneumatic tactile
  array and evaluated its safety and feasibility in an fMRI experiment. The development
  of a high spatial-temporal resolution tactile interface will open a wide range of
  complicated experiments for investigating the processing of tactile information
  inside human brain.
