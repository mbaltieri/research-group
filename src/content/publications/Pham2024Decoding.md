abstract: Decoding passive tactile shapes is a challenge in neuroscience. In this
  study, we extracted BOLD signals from three regions of interest, the intraparietal
  sulcus (IPS), the lateral occipital cortex (LOC), and the dorsolateral prefrontal
  cortex (dlPFC). All are known to be the shared areas between visions and haptics.
  Then we used a VDVAE (Very Deep Variational Auto-Encoder) to visualize the haptic
  information from these areas. This approach opens a new way for explaining the human
  tactile perception and possibly contributes to haptic-related diagnosis in future
  work.
