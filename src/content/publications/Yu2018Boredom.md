abstract: 'This paper presents the Homeo-Heterostatic Value Gradients (HHVG) algorithm
  as a formal account on the constructive interplay between boredom and curiosity
  which gives rise to effective exploration and superior forward model learning. We
  offer an instrumental view of action selection, in which an action serves to disclose
  outcomes that have intrinsic meaningfulness to an agent itself. This motivated two
  central algorithmic ingredients: devaluation and devaluation progress, both underpin
  agent''s cognition concerning intrinsically generated rewards. The two serve as
  an instantiation of homeostatic and heterostatic intrinsic motivation. A key insight
  from our algorithm is that the two seemingly opposite motivations can be reconciled—without
  which exploration and information-gathering cannot be effectively carried out. We
  supported this claim with empirical evidence, showing that boredom-enabled agents
  consistently outperformed other curious or explorative agent variants in model building
  benchmarks based on self-assisted experience accumulation.'
