abstract: There has been increasing interest in the integrated information theory
  (IIT) of consciousness, which hypothesizes that consciousness is integrated information
  within neuronal dynamics. However, the current formulation of IIT poses both practical
  and theoretical problems when empirically testing the theory by computing integrated
  information from neuronal signals. For example, measuring integrated information
  requires observing all the elements in a considered system at the same time, but
  this is practically very difficult. Here, we propose that some aspects of these
  problems are resolved by considering the topological dimensionality of shared attractor
  dynamics as an indicator of integrated information in continuous attractor dynamics.
  In this formulation, the effects of unobserved nodes on the attractor dynamics can
  be reconstructed using a technique called delay embedding, which allows us to identify
  the dimensionality of an embedded attractor from partial observations. We propose
  that the topological dimensionality represents a critical property of integrated
  information, as it is invariant to general coordinate transformations. We illustrate
  this new framework with simple examples and discuss how it fits with recent findings
  based on neural recordings from awake and anesthetized animals. This topological
  approach extends the existing notions of IIT to continuous dynamical systems and
  offers a much-needed framework for testing the theory with experimental data by
  substantially relaxing the conditions required for evaluating integrated information
  in real neural systems.
