abstract: We investigate the use of attentional neural network layers in order to
  learn a ‘behavior characterization’ which can be used to drive novelty search and
  curiosity-based policies. The space is structured towards answering a particular
  distribution of questions, which are used in a supervised way to train the attentional
  neural network. We find that in a 2d exploration task, the structure of the space
  successfully encodes local sensory-motor contingencies such that even a greedy local
  ‘do the most novel action’ policy with no reinforcement learning or evolution can
  explore the space quickly. We also apply this to a high/low number guessing game
  task, and find that guessing according to the learned attention profile performs
  active inference and can discover the correct number more quickly than an exact
  but passive approach.
