abstract: We investigate the non-trivial informational closure (NTIC) of a Bayesian
  hyperparameter inferring the underlying distribution of an identically and independently
  distributed finite random variable. For this we embed both the Bayesian hyper-parameter
  updating process and the random data process into a Markov chain. The original publication
  by Bertschinger et al. (2006) mentioned that NTIC may be able to capture an abstract
  notion of modeling that is agnostic to the specific internal structure of and existence
  of explicit representations within the modeling process. The Bayesian hyperparameter
  is of interest since it has a well defined interpretation as a model of the data
  process and at the same time its dynamics can be specified without reference to
  this interpretation. On the one hand we show explicitly that the NTIC of the hyperparameter
  increases indefinitely over time. On the other hand we attempt to establish a connection
  between a quantity that is a feature of the interpretation of the hyperparameter
  as a model, namely the information gain, and the one-step pointwise NTIC which is
  a quantity that does not depend on this interpretation. We find that in general
  we cannot use the one-step pointwise NTIC as an indicator for information gain.
  We hope this exploratory work can lead to further rigorous studies of the relation
  between NTIC and modeling.
