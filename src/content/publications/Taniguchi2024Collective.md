abstract: This paper proposes a new conceptual framework called Collective Predictive
  Coding as a Model of Science (CPC-MS) to formalize and understand scientific activities.
  Building on the idea of collective predictive coding originally developed to explain
  symbol emergence, CPC-MS models science as a decentralized Bayesian inference process
  carried out by a community of agents. The framework describes how individual scientists'
  partial observations and internal representations are integrated through communication
  and peer review to produce shared external scientific knowledge. Key aspects of
  scientific practice like experimentation, hypothesis formation, theory development,
  and paradigm shifts are mapped onto components of the probabilistic graphical model.
  This paper discusses how CPC-MS provides insights into issues like social objectivity
  in science, scientific progress, and the potential impacts of AI on research. The
  generative view of science offers a unified way to analyze scientific activities
  and could inform efforts to automate aspects of the scientific process. Overall,
  CPC-MS aims to provide an intuitive yet formal model of science as a collective
  cognitive activity.
