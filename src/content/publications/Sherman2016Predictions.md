abstract: It is clear that prior expectations shape perceptual decision-making, yet
  their contribution to the construction of subjective decision confidence remains
  largely unexplored. We recorded fMRI data while participants made perceptual decisions
  and confidence judgments, manipulating perceptual prior expectations while controlling
  for potential confounds of attention. Results show that subjective confidence increases
  as expectations increasingly support the decision, and that this relationship is
  associated with BOLD activity in right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG). Specifically,
  rIFG is sensitive to the discrepancy between expectation and decision (mismatch),
  and higher mismatch responses are associated with lower decision confidence. Connectivity
  analyses revealed expectancy information to be represented in bilateral orbitofrontal
  cortex and sensory signals to be represented in intracalcarine sulcus. Together,
  our results indicate that predictive information is integrated into subjective confidence
  in rIFG, and reveal an occipital-frontal network that constructs confidence from
  top-down and bottom-up signals. This interpretation was further supported by exploratory
  findings that the white matter density of right orbitofrontal cortex negatively
  predicted its respective contribution to the construction of confidence. Our findings
  advance our understanding of the neural basis of subjective perceptual processes
  by revealing an occipitofrontal functional network that integrates prior beliefs
  into the construction of confidence.
