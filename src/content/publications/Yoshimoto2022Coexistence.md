abstract: Despite the multiple regions and neural networks associated with value-based
  decision-making, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is possible a particularly important
  one. Although the role of the OFC in reinforcer devaluation tasks, which assess
  the ability to represent identity, sensory qualities, and subjective values of the
  expected outcomes, has been established, the specific aspect represented in this
  area remains unclear. In this study, using functional magnetic resonance imaging,
  wherein participants rated the palatability of 128 food items using photographs,
  we investigated whether the human OFC represents object identity, sensory qualities,
  or value. Employing many items helped us dissociate object identity from sensory
  qualities and values; the inferred sensory qualities of identical items were manipulated
  by a change in metabolic state. Moreover, value differences between items were analytically
  controlled by employing a technique similar to age adjustment. The palatability
  ratings for food items significantly decreased after a meal. Using representational
  similarity analysis, we confirmed that the OFC represents value. Moreover, identical
  items were represented similarly in the lateral OFC in a given metabolic state;
  however, these representations were altered post-feeding. Importantly, this change
  was not explained by subjective value, suggesting that the OFC represents sensory
  quality and value, but not object identity.
