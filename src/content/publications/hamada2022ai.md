abstract: 'Wellbeing AI has been becoming a new trend in individuals'' mental health,
  organizational health, and flourishing our societies. Various applications of wellbeing
  AI have been introduced to our daily lives. While social relationships within groups
  are a critical factor for wellbeing, the development of wellbeing AI for social
  interactions remains relatively scarce. In this paper, we provide an overview of
  the mediative role of AI-augmented agents for social interactions. First, we discuss
  the two-dimensional framework for classifying wellbeing AI: individual/group and
  analysis/intervention. Furthermore, wellbeing AI touches on intervening social relationships
  between human-human interactions since positive social relationships are key to
  human wellbeing. This intervention may raise technical and ethical challenges. We
  discuss opportunities and challenges of the relational approach with wellbeing AI
  to promote wellbeing in our societies.'
