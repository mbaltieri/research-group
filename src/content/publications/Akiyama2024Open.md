abstract: Recent works have suggested that language-based foundation models contain
  commonsense knowledge and are capable of performing basic reasoning. This has significant
  promise in robotics for task-level planning. As an example, the recent EgoPlan-Bench
  benchmark studies egocentric, embodied planning, measured through multiple-choice
  questions on captioned videos. In this work, we thoroughly examine the benchmark
  using open-source 7/13B-parameter models, and investigate the impact of different
  sources of training data, as well as prompting strategies that are widely used outside
  of the robotics domain. Our experiments show that (1) in-domain and out-of-domain
  performance is, unsurprisingly, connected with training and evaluation dataset overlap,
  and (2) surprisingly, prompting strategies that have been effective in other domains,
  fail to significantly increase performance here.
