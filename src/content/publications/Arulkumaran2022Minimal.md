abstract: 'Minimal criterion co-evolution (MCC) is an evolutionary algorithm

  that uses a simple reproduction constraint between two interacting

  populations to drive an open-ended search process. While it has

  previously been applied to parameterise simple agents and envi-

  ronments, in this work we extend its use to the generation of art:

  synthesising both images and music. As a creative AI tool which

  does not require any data, the use of MCC emphasises the design

  of the creative medium'
