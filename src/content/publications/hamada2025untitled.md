abstract: This paper examines why neuroscientists in the 2020s are using large language
  models rather than brains as research subjects, from temporal, systemic, and career-oriented
  perspectives. First, we reviewed the evolution of neuroscience into big science
  and the development of integrated data platforms since the 2010s. Next, as a new
  movement, we discussed the emergence of representation alignment and NeuroAI, which
  use pre-trained DNNs including large language models as research targets and platform.
  Furthermore, we introduced our research on quantifying psychological constructs
  using language models and discussed its significance as analytical platform of psychological
  constructs. Through this, we explore the potential of pre-trained DNN as a new research
  method in neuroscience and consider the career turning point faced by early-career
  (neuro)scientists.
