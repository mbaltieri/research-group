abstract: As the apparent intelligence of artificial neural networks (ANNs) advances,
  they are increasingly likened to the functional networks and information processing
  capabilities of the human brain.Such comparisons have typically focused on particular
  modalities, such as vision or language.The next frontier is to use the latest advances
  in ANNs to design and investigate scalable models of higher-level cognitive processes,
  such as conscious information access, which have historically lacked concrete and
  specific hypotheses for scientific evaluation. In this work, we propose and then
  empirically assess an embodied agent with a structure based on global workspace
  theory (GWT) as specified in the recently proposed "indicator properties" of consciousness.
  In contrast to prior works on GWT which utilized single modalities, our agent is
  trained to navigate 3D environments based on realistic audiovisual inputs. We find
  that the global workspace architecture performs better and more robustly at smaller
  working memory sizes, as compared to a standard recurrent architecture. Beyond performance,
  we perform a series of analyses on the learned representations of our architecture
  and share findings that point to task complexity and regularization being essential
  for feature learning and the development of meaningful attentional patterns within
  the workspace.
