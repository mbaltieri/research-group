abstract: 'One view of the neocortical architecture is that every region functions
  based on a universal computational principle. Contrary to this, we postulated that
  each cortical region has its own specific algorithm and functional properties. This
  idea led us to hypothesize that unique temporal patterns should be associated with
  each region, with the functional commonalities and variances among regions reflecting
  in the temporal structure of their neural signals. To investigate these hypotheses,
  we employed deep learning to predict electrodes locations in the macaque brain using
  single-channel ECoG signals. To do this, we first divided the brain into seven regions
  based on anatomical landmarks, and trained a deep learning model to predict the
  electrode location from the ECoG signals. Remarkably, the model achieved an average
  accuracy of 33.6%, significantly above the chance level of 14.3%. All seven regions
  exhibited above-chance prediction accuracy. The model’s feature vectors identified
  two main clusters: one including higher visual areas and temporal cortex, and another
  encompassing the remaining other regions.These results bolster the argument for
  unique regional dynamics within the cortex, highlighting the diverse functional
  specializations present across cortical areas.'
