abstract: The ability to integrate information in the brain is considered to be an
  essential property for cognition and consciousness. Integrated Information Theory
  (IIT) hypothesizes that the amount of integrated information ( Φ ) in the brain
  is related to the level of consciousness. IIT proposes that, to quantify information
  integration in a system as a whole, integrated information should be measured across
  the partition of the system at which information loss caused by partitioning is
  minimized, called the Minimum Information Partition (MIP). The computational cost
  for exhaustively searching for the MIP grows exponentially with system size, making
  it difficult to apply IIT to real neural data. It has been previously shown that,
  if a measure of Φ satisfies a mathematical property, submodularity, the MIP can
  be found in a polynomial order by an optimization algorithm. However, although the
  first version of Φ is submodular, the later versions are not. In this study, we
  empirically explore to what extent the algorithm can be applied to the non-submodular
  measures of Φ by evaluating the accuracy of the algorithm in simulated data and
  real neural data. We find that the algorithm identifies the MIP in a nearly perfect
  manner even for the non-submodular measures. Our results show that the algorithm
  allows us to measure Φ in large systems within a practical amount of time.
