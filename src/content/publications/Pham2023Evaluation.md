abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) that are heavily inspired by the human
  brain now achieve human-level performance across multiple task domains. ANNs have
  thus drawn attention in neuroscience, raising the possibility of providing a framework
  for understanding the information encoded in the human brain. However, the correspondence
  between ANNs and the brain cannot be measured directly. They differ in outputs and
  substrates, neurons vastly outnumber their ANN analogs (i.e., nodes), and the key
  algorithm responsible for most of modern ANN training (i.e., backpropagation) is
  likely absent from the brain. Neuroscientists have thus taken a variety of approaches
  to examine the similarity between the brain and ANNs at multiple levels of their
  information hierarchy. This review provides an overview of the currently available
  approaches and their limitations for evaluating brain–ANN correspondence.
