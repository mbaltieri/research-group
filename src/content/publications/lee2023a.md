abstract: As subjective experiences go, beauty matters. Although aesthetics has long
  been a topic of study, research in this area has not resulted in a level of interest
  and progress commensurate with its import. Here, we briefly discuss two recent advances,
  one computational and one neuroscientific, and their pertinence to aesthetic processing.
  First, we hypothesize that deep neural networks provide the capacity to model representations
  essential to aesthetic experiences. Second, we highlight the principal gradient
  as an axis of information processing that is potentially key to examining where
  and how aesthetic processing takes place in the brain. In concert with established
  neuroimaging tools, we suggest that these advances may cultivate a new frontier
  in the understanding of our aesthetic experiences.
