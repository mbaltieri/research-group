abstract: We present a first formal analysis of specific and complete local integration.
  Complete local integration was previously proposed as a criterion for detecting
  entities or wholes in distributed dynamical systems. Such entities in turn were
  conceived to form the basis of a theory of emergence of agents within dynamical
  systems. Here, we give a more thorough account of the underlying formal measures.
  The main contribution is the disintegration theorem which reveals a special role
  of completely locally integrated patterns (what we call ι-entities) within the trajectories
  they occur in. Apart from proving this theorem we introduce the disintegration hierarchy
  and its refinement-free version as a way to structure the patterns in a trajectory.
  Furthermore, we construct the least upper bound and provide a candidate for the
  greatest lower bound of specific local integration. Finally, we calculate the ι
  -entities in small example systems as a first sanity check and find that ι -entities
  largely fulfil simple expectations.
