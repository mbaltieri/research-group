abstract: The non-stationarity of resting-state brain activity has received increasing
  attention in recent years. Functional connectivity (FC) analysis with short sliding
  windows and coactivation pattern (CAP) analysis are two widely used methods for
  assessing the dynamic characteristics of brain activity observed with functional
  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, the statistical nature of the dynamics
  captured by these techniques needs to be verified. In this study, we found that
  the results of CAP analysis were similar for real fMRI data and simulated stationary
  data with matching covariance structures and spectral contents. We also found that,
  for both the real and simulated data, CAPs were clustered into spatially heterogeneous
  modules. Moreover, for each of the modules in the real data, a spatially similar
  module was found in the simulated data. The present results suggest that care needs
  to be taken when interpreting observations drawn from CAP analysis as it does not
  necessarily reflect non-stationarity or a mixture of states in resting brain activity.
