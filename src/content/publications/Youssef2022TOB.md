abstract: Stress affects behavior and involves critical dynamic changes at multiple
  levels ranging from molecular pathways to neural circuits and behavior. Abnormalities
  at any of these levels lead to decreased stress resilience and pathological behavior.
  However, temporal modulation of molecular pathways underlying stress response remains
  poorly understood. Transducer of ErbB2.1, known as TOB, (TOB1) is involved in different
  physiological functions, including cellular stress and immediate response to stimulation.
  In this study, we investigated the role of TOB in the brain's stress machinery at
  molecular, neural circuit, and behavioral levels. Interestingly, TOB protein levels
  increased after mice were exposed to acute stress. At the neural circuit level,
  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) suggested that intra-hippocampal and
  hippocampal-prefrontal connectivity were dysregulated in Tob knockout (Tob-KO) mice.
  Electrophysiological recordings in hippocampal slices showed increased postsynaptic
  AMPAR-mediated neurotransmission, accompanied by decreased GABA neurotransmission
  and subsequently altered Excitatory/Inhibitory balance after Tob deletion. At the
  behavioral level, Tob-KO mice show abnormal, hippocampus-dependent, contextual fear
  conditioning and extinction, and depression-like behaviors. On the other hand, increased
  anxiety observed in Tob-KO mice is hippocampus-independent. At the molecular level,
  we observed decreased stress-induced LCN2 expression and ERK phosphorylation, as
  well as increased MKP-1 expression. This study suggests that TOB serves as an important
  modulator in hippocampal stress signaling machinery. In summary, we show a molecular
  pathway and neural circuit mechanism by which Tob deletion contributes to expression
  of pathological stress-related behavior.
