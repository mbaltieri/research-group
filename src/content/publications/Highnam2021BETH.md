abstract: We present the BETH cybersecurity dataset foranomaly detection and out-of-distribution
  analy-sis. With real “anomalies” collected using a noveltracking system, our dataset
  contains over eightmillion data points tracking 23 hosts. Each hosthas captured
  benign activity and, at most, a singleattack, enabling cleaner behavioural analysis.
  Inaddition to being one of the most modern and ex-tensive cybersecurity datasets
  available, BETH en-ables the development of anomaly detection algo-rithms on heterogeneously-structured
  real-worlddata,  with clear downstream applications.   Wegive details on the data
  collection, suggestions onpre-processing, and analysis with initial anomalydetection
  benchmarks on a subset of the data.
