abstract: Recent findings from cognitive neuroscience indicate that individual differences
  in various cognitive traits such as personality and intelligence are reflected in
  macroscopic brain structure that can be quantified with magnetic resonance imaging
  (MRI) techniques. While the initial aim of such research was to identify brain regions
  where structural variation correlated with cognitive functions, the flurry of correlational
  findings suggest that MRI scans of the human brain can be used to make predictions
  about individuals. We have confirmed this idea by constructing highly accurate prediction
  models for a multitude of cognitive traits using a machine learning technique called
  elastic net. We are currently implementing those prediction models on a web-based
  service called Neuroprofile where anyone can upload their brain scan to view the
  predicted cognitive traits. This service will be provided to make the contents of
  MRI-based brain health check-ups much richer and more informative.
