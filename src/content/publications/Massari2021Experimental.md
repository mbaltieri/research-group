abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is known to be often unsuccessful in environments
  with sparse extrinsic rewards. A possible countermeasure is to endow RL agents with
  an intrinsic reward function, or 'intrinsic motivation', which rewards the agent
  based on certain features of the current sensor state. An intrinsic reward function
  based on the principle of empowerment assigns rewards proportional to the amount
  of control the agent has over its own sensors. We implemented a variation on a recently
  proposed intrinsically motivated agent, which we refer to as the 'curious' agent,
  and an empowerment-inspired agent. The former leverages sensor state encoding with
  a variational autoencoder, while the latter predicts the next sensor state via a
  variational information bottleneck. We compared the performance of both agents to
  that of an advantage actor-critic baseline in four sparse reward grid worlds. Both
  the empowerment agent and its curious competitor seem to benefit to similar extents
  from their intrinsic rewards. This provides some experimental support to the conjecture
  that empowerment can be used to drive exploration.
