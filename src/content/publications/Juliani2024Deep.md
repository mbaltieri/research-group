abstract: Psychedelic therapy has seen a resurgence of interest in the past decade,
  with promising clinical outcomes for treatment of a variety of psychopathologies.
  In response to this success, a number of theoretical models have been proposed to
  account for psychedelic's positive therapeutic effects. One of the more prominent
  models is `RElaxed Beliefs Under pSychedelics,' (REBUS) which suggests that psychedelics
  act therapeutically by relaxing the strength of maladaptive high-level beliefs encoded
  in the brain. The more recent `CANAL' model of psychopathology builds on the explanatory
  framework of REBUS by proposing that canalization (the development of overly rigid
  belief landscapes) may be a primary factor in psychopathology. Here we take inspiration
  from learning theory in deep neural networks to develop a series of refinements
  to the original CANAL model. Our primary theoretical contribution is to disambiguate
  two separate optimization landscapes underlying belief representation, and describe
  the unique pathologies which can arise from the canalization of each. Along each
  dimension we identify pathologies of either too much or too little canalization,
  suggesting that at the very least canalization does not have a linear relationship
  with psychopathology. In this expanded paradigm, we demonstrate the ability to make
  novel predictions regarding which psychopathologies may be amenable to psychedelic
  therapy, as well as what forms of psychedelic therapy may ultimately be most beneficial
  for a given individual.
