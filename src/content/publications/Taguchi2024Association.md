abstract: The brain comprises a complex network of interacting regions. To understand
  the roles and mechanisms of this complex network, its structural features related
  to specific cognitive functions need to be elucidated. Among such relationships,
  recent developments in neuroscience highlight the link between network bidirectionality
  and conscious perception. Given the essential roles of both feedforward and feedback
  signals in conscious perception, it is surmised that subnetworks with bidirectional
  interactions are critical. However, the link between such subnetworks and conscious
  perception remains unclear due to the network’s complexity. In this study, we propose
  a framework for extracting subnetworks with strong bidirectional interactions—termed
  the “cores” of a network—from brain activity. We applied this framework to resting-state
  and task-based fMRI data to identify regions forming strongly bidirectional cores.
  We then explored the association of these cores with conscious perception and cognitive
  functions. The central cores predominantly included cerebral cortical regions, which
  are crucial for conscious perception, rather than subcortical regions. Furthermore,
  the cores were composed of previously reported regions in which electrical stimulation
  altered conscious perception. These results suggest a link between the bidirectional
  cores and conscious perception. A meta-analysis and comparison of the core structure
  with a cortical functional connectivity gradient suggested that the central cores
  were related to lower-order sensorimotor functions. An ablation study emphasized
  the importance of incorporating bidirectionality, not merely interaction strength
  for these outcomes. The proposed framework provides novel insight into the roles
  of network cores with strong bidirectional interactions in conscious perception
  and lower-order sensorimotor functions.
