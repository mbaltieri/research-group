abstract: We summarize the original formulation of the free energy principle and highlight
  some technical issues. We discuss how these issues affect related results involving
  generalised coordinates and, where appropriate, mention consequences for and reveal,
  up to now unacknowledged, differences from newer formulations of the free energy
  principle. In particular, we reveal that various definitions of the “Markov blanket”
  proposed in different works are not equivalent. We show that crucial steps in the
  free energy argument, which involve rewriting the equations of motion of systems
  with Markov blankets, are not generally correct without additional (previously unstated)
  assumptions. We prove by counterexamples that the original free energy lemma, when
  taken at face value, is wrong. We show further that this free energy lemma, when
  it does hold, implies the equality of variational density and ergodic conditional
  density. The interpretation in terms of Bayesian inference hinges on this point,
  and we hence conclude that it is not sufficiently justified. Additionally, we highlight
  that the variational densities presented in newer formulations of the free energy
  principle and lemma are parametrised by different variables than in older works,
  leading to a substantially different interpretation of the theory. Note that we
  only highlight some specific problems in the discussed publications. These problems
  do not rule out conclusively that the general ideas behind the free energy principle
  are worth pursuing.
