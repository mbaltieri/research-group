abstract: 'Information processing in neural systems can be described and analyzed
  at multiple spatiotemporal scales. Generally, information at lower levels is more
  fine-grained but can be coarse-grained at higher levels. However, only information
  processed at specific scales of coarse-graining appears to be available for conscious
  awareness. We do not have direct experience of information available at the scale
  of individual neurons, which is noisy and highly stochastic. Neither do we have
  experience of more macro-scale interactions, such as interpersonal communications.
  Neurophysiological evidence suggests that conscious experiences co-vary with information
  encoded in coarse-grained neural states such as the firing pattern of a population
  of neurons. In this article, we introduce a new informational theory of consciousness:
  Information Closure Theory of Consciousness (ICT). We hypothesize that conscious
  processes are processes which form non-trivial informational closure (NTIC) with
  respect to the environment at certain coarse-grained scales. This hypothesis implies
  that conscious experience is confined due to informational closure from conscious
  processing to other coarse-grained scales. Information Closure Theory of Consciousness
  (ICT) proposes new quantitative definitions of both conscious content and conscious
  level. With the parsimonious definitions and a hypothesize, ICT provides explanations
  and predictions of various phenomena associated with consciousness. The implications
  of ICT naturally reconcile issues in many existing theories of consciousness and
  provides explanations for many of our intuitions about consciousness. Most importantly,
  ICT demonstrates that information can be the common language between consciousness
  and physical reality.'
