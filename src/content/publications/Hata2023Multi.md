abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive neuroimaging technique
  that is useful for identifying normal developmental and aging processes and for
  data sharing. Marmosets have a relatively shorter life expectancy than other primates,
  including humans, because they grow and age faster. Therefore, the common marmoset
  model is effective in aging research. The current study investigated the aging process
  of the marmoset brain and provided an open MRI database of marmosets across a wide
  age range. The Brain/MINDS Marmoset Brain MRI Dataset contains brain MRI information
  from 216 marmosets ranging in age from 1 and 10 years. At the time of its release,
  it is the largest public dataset in the world. It also includes multi-contrast MRI
  images. In addition, 91 of 216 animals have corresponding high-resolution ex vivo
  MRI datasets. Our MRI database, available at the Brain/MINDS Data Portal, might
  help to understand the effects of various factors, such as age, sex, body size,
  and fixation, on the brain. It can also contribute to and accelerate brain science
  studies worldwide.
