abstract: Seth (2025)’s biological naturalism builds on ideas from predictive processing, the free
  energy principle and active inference to 1) argue that only (some) biological systems are
  in the consciousness business, and to 2) refute the possibility of artificial consciousness,
  i.e. consciousness in AI and other artificial systems. We find this perspective problematic
  for a few different reasons.
