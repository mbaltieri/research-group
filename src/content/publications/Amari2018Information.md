abstract: Two geometrical structures have been extensively studied for a manifold
  of probability distributions. One is based on the Fisher information metric, which
  is invariant under reversible transformations of random variables, while the other
  is based on the Wasserstein distance of optimal transportation, which reflects the
  structure of the distance between underlying random variables. Here, we propose
  a new information-geometrical theory that provides a unified framework connecting
  the Wasserstein distance and Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence. We primarily considered
  a discrete case consisting of n elements and studied the geometry of the probability
  simplex Sn−1, which is the set of all probability distributions over n elements.
  The Wasserstein distance was introduced in Sn−1 by the optimal transportation of
  commodities from distribution p to distribution q, where p, q ∈ Sn−1. We relaxed
  the optimal transportation by using entropy, which was introduced by Cuturi. The
  optimal solution was called the entropy-relaxed stochastic transportation plan.
  The entropyrelaxed optimal cost C( p, q) was computationally much less demanding
  than the original Wasserstein distance but does not define a distance because it
  is not minimized at p = q. To define a proper divergence while retaining the computational
  advantage, we first introduced a divergence function in the manifold Sn−1 × Sn−1
  composed of all optimal transportation plans. We fully explored the information
  geometry of the manifold of the optimal transportation plans and subsequently constructed
  a new one-parameter family of divergences in Sn−1 that are related to both the Wasserstein
  distance and the KL-divergence.
