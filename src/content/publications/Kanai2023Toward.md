abstract: While falsifiability has been broadly discussed as a desirable property
  of a theory of consciousness, in this paper, we introduce the meta-theoretic concept
  of "Universality" as an additional desirable property for a theory of consciousness.
  The concept of universality, often assumed in physics, posits that the fundamental
  laws of nature are consistent and apply equally everywhere in the universe, and
  remain constant over time. This assumption is crucial in science, acting as a guiding
  principle for developing and testing theories. When applied to theories of consciousness,
  universality can be defined as the ability of a theory to determine whether any
  fully described dynamical system is conscious or non-conscious. Importantly, for
  a theory to be universal, the determinant of consciousness needs to be defined as
  an intrinsic property of a system as opposed replying on the interpretation of the
  external observer. The importance of universality originates from the consideration
  that given that consciousness is a natural phenomenon, it could in principle manifest
  in any physical system that satisfies certain set of condition whether it is biological
  or non-biological. To date, apart from a few exceptions, most existing theories
  do not possess this property. Instead, they tend to make predictions as to the neural
  correlates of consciousness based on the interpretations of brain functions, which
  makes those theories only applicable to brain-centric systems. While current functionalist
  theories of consciousness tend to be heavily reliant on our interpretations of brain
  functions, we argue that functionalist theories could be converted to a universal
  theory by specifying mathematical formulations of the constituent concepts. While
  neurobiological and functionalist theories retain their utility in practice, we
  will eventually need a universal theory to fully explain why certain types of systems
  possess consciousness.
