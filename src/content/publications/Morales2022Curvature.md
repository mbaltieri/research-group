abstract: The massless Dirac equation is studied in curved spacetime on the (2+1)-dimensional
  graphene sheet in time-dependent geometries. Emergent pseudo-gauge fields are found
  both in the adiabatic regime and, for high-frequency periodic geometries, in the
  non-adiabatic regime for a generic FLRW metric in Fermi normal coordinates. The
  former extends the conventionally understood homogeneous pseudo-gauge field to include
  weak temporal inhomogeneities. The latter, through the usage of Floquet theory,
  represent a new class of emergent pseudo-gauge field, and is argued to potentially
  provide a condensed matter realization of cosmological high-frequency geometries.
