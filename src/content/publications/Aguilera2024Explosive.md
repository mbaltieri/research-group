abstract: Higher-order interactions underlie complex phenomena in systems such as
  biological and artificial neural networks, but their study is challenging due to
  the lack of tractable standard models. By leveraging the maximum entropy principle
  in curved statistical manifolds, here we introduce curved neural networks as a class
  of prototypical models for studying higher-order phenomena. Through exact mean-field
  descriptions, we show that these curved neural networks implement a self-regulating
  annealing process that can accelerate memory retrieval, leading to explosive order-disorder
  phase transitions with multi-stability and hysteresis effects. Moreover, by analytically
  exploring their memory capacity using the replica trick near ferromagnetic and spin-glass
  phase boundaries, we demonstrate that these networks enhance memory capacity over
  the classical associative-memory networks. Overall, the proposed framework provides
  parsimonious models amenable to analytical study, revealing novel higher-order phenomena
  in complex network systems.
