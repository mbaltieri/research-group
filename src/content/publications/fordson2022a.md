abstract: Emotions are central to physical and mental health and general well being.
  There is a great need to affordably and non invasively track moment to moment changes
  in emotional states and their conversion into chronic conditions. Blood Volume Pulse
  (BVP) is a widely used sensor for measuring blood volume changes, heart rate, and
  is embedded in numerous biofeedback systems and applications. Nonetheless, the role
  of BVP features relating to emotion detection is lacking in current studies. While
  engineers have become more interested in the analysis of heart rate variability
  (HRV) and its regulation by the autonomic nervous system, there is a need to design
  systems that can investigate their variations due to real life stressors and how
  people respond to emotions differently. The study employs the database for emotion
  analysis using physiological signals (DEAP) in assessing emotional responses of
  subjects according to valence arousal scale to music videos. We demonstrate a novel
  approach to augmenting original features and normalized features of blood volume
  in peripheral vessels. The features of HRV include tachogram, multi-scale entropy
  (MSE), power spectral density (PSD), and statistical moments derived from BVP. We
  further propose embedding age and gender of participants as a weight to the augmented
  features. We finally used multilayer perceptron (MLP) as classifier to evaluate
  our approach. Obtained results show an 8.4% and 7.3% improvement in F1-score in
  the valence and arousal dimension respectively. Such advances may aid in building
  closed-loop emotion detection and intervention systems.
