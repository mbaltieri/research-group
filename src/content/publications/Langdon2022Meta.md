abstract: The intersection between neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) research
  has created synergistic effects in both fields. While neuroscientific discoveries
  have inspired the development of AI architectures, new ideas and algorithms from
  AI research have produced new ways to study brain mechanisms. A well-known example
  is the case of reinforcement learning (RL), which has stimulated neuroscience research
  on how animals learn to adjust their behavior to maximize reward. In this review
  article, we cover recent collaborative work between the two fields in the context
  of meta-learning and its extension to social cognition and consciousness. Meta-learning
  refers to the ability to learn how to learn, such as learning to adjust hyperparameters
  of existing learning algorithms and how to use existing models and knowledge to
  efficiently solve new tasks. This meta-learning capability is important for making
  existing AI systems more adaptive and flexible to efficiently solve new tasks. Since
  this is one of the areas where there is a gap between human performance and current
  AI systems, successful collaboration should produce new ideas and progress. Starting
  from the role of RL algorithms in driving neuroscience, we discuss recent developments
  in deep RL applied to modeling prefrontal cortex functions. Even from a broader
  perspective, we discuss the similarities and differences between social cognition
  and meta-learning, and finally conclude with speculations on the potential links
  between intelligence as endowed by model-based RL and consciousness. For future
  work we highlight data efficiency, autonomy and intrinsic motivation as key research
  areas for advancing both fields.
