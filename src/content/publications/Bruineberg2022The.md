abstract: 'The 35 commentaries cover a wide range of topics and take many different
  stances on the issues explored by the target article. We have organised our response
  to the commentaries around three central questions: Are Friston blankets just Pearl
  blankets? What ontological and metaphysical commitments are implied by the use of
  Friston blankets? What kind of explanatory work are Friston blankets capable of?
  We conclude our reply with a short critical reflection on the indiscriminate use
  of both Markov blankets and the free energy principle.'
