abstract: When ambiguous visual stimuli are presented to the eyes, conscious perception
  can spontaneously alternate across the competing interpretations – which was known
  as bistable perception. The spontaneous alternation of perception might indicate
  a connection between bistable perception and the dynamic interaction of brain networks.
  Here, we hypothesized that individual differences in perceptual dynamics may be
  reflected in dynamics of spontaneous neural activities. To test this idea, we investigated
  the relationship between the percept duration and the reconfiguration patterns of
  dynamic brain networks as measured by the functional connectivity (FC) during the
  resting state. Firstly, we found that individual difference of percept duration
  is associated with the temporal variability of the brain regions which were previously
  reported in studies of bistable perception, including anterior cingulate cortex
  (ACC), dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex
  (DLPFC), superior parietal lobule (SPL), inferior parietal lobule (IPL), precuneus,
  insula, and V5. Secondly, there is a positive relationship between the temporal
  variability within the frontal-parietal network (FPN) and the percept duration.
  Thirdly, our results indicated that individual difference of bistable perception
  was related to the dynamic interaction between large-scale functional networks including
  default mode network (DMN), FPN, cingulo-opercular network (CON), dorsal attention
  network (DAN), salience network (SN), memory retrieval network (MRN). Altogether,
  our results demonstrated that inter-individual variability in bistable perception
  was associated with dynamic coupling of brain regions and networks involved in primary
  visual processing, spatial attention, and cognitive control.
