abstract: Response inhibition is a primary executive control function that allows
  the withholding of inappropriate responses, and requires appropriate perception
  of the external environment to achieve a behavioral goal. It remains unclear, however,
  how response inhibition is achieved when goal-relevant information involves perceptual
  uncertainty. Twenty-six human participants of both sexes performed a go/no-go task
  where visually presented random-dot motion stimuli involved perceptual uncertainties.
  The right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC) was involved in response inhibition, and
  the middle temporal (MT) region showed greater activity when dot motions involved
  less uncertainty. A neocortical temporal region in the superior temporal sulcus
  (STS) specifically showed greater activity during response inhibition in more perceptually
  certain trials. In this STS region, activity was greater when response inhibition
  was successful than when it failed. Directional effective connectivity analysis
  revealed that in more coherent trials, the MT and STS regions showed enhanced connectivity
  to the rIFC, whereas in less coherent trials, the signal direction was reversed.
  These results suggest that a reversible fronto-temporal functional network guides
  response inhibition under perceptual uncertainty, and in this network, perceptual
  information in the MT is converted to control information in the rIFC via STS, enabling
  achievement of response inhibition.
