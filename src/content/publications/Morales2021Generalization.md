abstract: The maximum entropy principle (MEP) is one of the most prominent methods
  to investigate and model complex systems. Despite its popularity, the standard form
  of the MEP can only generate Boltzmann-Gibbs distributions, which are ill-suited
  for many scenarios of interest. As a principled approach to extend the reach of
  the MEP, this paper revisits its foundations in information geometry and shows how
  the geometry of curved statistical manifolds naturally leads to a generalization
  of the MEP based on the Rényi entropy. By establishing a bridge between non-Euclidean
  geometry and the MEP, our proposal sets a solid foundation for the numerous applications
  of the Rényi entropy, and enables a range of novel methods for complex systems analysis.
