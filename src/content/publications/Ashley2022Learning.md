abstract: Lately, there has been a resurgence of interest in using supervised learning
  to solve reinforcement learning problems. Recent work in this area has largely focused
  on learning command-conditioned policies. We investigate the potential of one such
  method -- upside-down reinforcement learning -- to work with commands that specify
  a desired relationship between some scalar value and the observed return. We show
  that upside-down reinforcement learning can learn to carry out such commands online
  in a tabular bandit setting and in CartPole with non-linear function approximation.
  By doing so, we demonstrate the power of this family of methods and open the way
  for their practical use under more complicated command structures.
