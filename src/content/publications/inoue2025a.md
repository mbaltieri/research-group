abstract: Silent speech decoding, which performs unvocalized human speech recognition
  from electroencephalography/electromyography (EEG/EMG), increases accessibility
  for speech-impaired humans. However, data collection is difficult and performed
  using varying experimental setups, making it nontrivial to collect a large, homogeneous
  dataset. In this study we introduce neural networks that can handle EEG/EMG with
  heterogeneous electrode placements and show strong performance in silent speech
  decoding via multi-task training on large-scale EEG/EMG datasets. We achieve improved
  word classification accuracy in both healthy participants (95.3%), and a speech-impaired
  patient (54.5%), substantially outperforming models trained on single-subject data
  (70.1% and 13.2%). Moreover, our models also show gains in cross-language calibration
  performance. This increase in accuracy suggests the feasibility of developing practical
  silent speech decoding systems, particularly for speech-impaired patients.
