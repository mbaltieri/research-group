abstract: The recent link discovered between generalized Legendre transforms and curved
  (i.e. non-Euclidean) statistical manifolds suggests a fundamental reason behind
  the ubiquity of Rényi's divergence and entropy in a wide range of physical phenomena.
  However, these early findings still provide little intuition on the nature of this
  relationship and its implications for physical systems. Here we shed new light on
  the Legendre transform by revealing the consequences of its deformation via symplectic
  geometry, complexification, and stochastic thermodynamics. These findings reveal
  a novel common framework that leads to a principled and unified understanding of
  physical systems that are not well-described by classic information-theoretic quantities.
