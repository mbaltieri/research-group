abstract: 'We discuss our attempts to develop a short-term phenomenological training
  program for training naïve participants in phenomenological skills. After reviewing
  existing methodologies for collecting phenomenological data and clarifying the benefit
  of the short-term training approach, we present two training programs and two experiments
  that tested their effectiveness. Experiment 1 tested the two-stage training program,
  which consists of (i) the illusion training which instructs participants to describe
  the experience of a visual illusion and (ii) the guidance training which offers
  individualized feedbacks for improving their description. This program proved effective,
  but also excessively skill-demanding. Experiment 2 tested the one-stage training
  program, consisting only of the illusion training; it was easier to use, but exhibited
  a smaller training effect. The paper concludes by delineating methodological lessons
  from the experiments focusing on three themes: (i) Individual difference in phenomenological
  aptitude; (ii) Bounded transferability of phenomenological skills; (iii) Active
  intervention in the learning process.'
