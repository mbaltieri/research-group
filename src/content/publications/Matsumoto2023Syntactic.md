abstract: Mathematical expressions consist of recursive combinations of numbers, variables,
  and operators. According to theoretical linguists, the syntactic mechanisms of natural
  language also provide a basis for mathematics. To date, however, no theoretically
  rigorous investigation has been conducted to support such arguments. Therefore,
  this study uses a methodology based on theoretical linguistics to analyze the syntactic
  properties of mathematical expressions. Through a review of recent behavioral and
  neuroimaging studies on mathematical syntax, we report several inconsistencies with
  theoretical linguistics, such as the use of ternary structures. To address these,
  we propose that a syntactic category called Applicative plays a central role in
  analyzing mathematical expressions with seemingly ternary structures by combining
  binary structures. Besides basic arithmetic expressions, we also examine algebraic
  equations and complex expressions such as integral and differential calculi. This
  study is the first attempt at building a comprehensive framework for analyzing the
  syntactic structures of mathematical expressions.
