abstract: In analysis of multi-component complex systems, such as neural systems,
  identifying groups of units that share similar functionality will aid understanding
  of the underlying structures of the system. To find such a grouping, it is useful
  to evaluate to what extent the units of the system are separable. Separability or
  inseparability can be evaluated by quantifying how much information would be lost
  if the system were partitioned into subsystems, and the interactions between the
  subsystems were hypothetically removed. A system of two independent subsystems are
  completely separable without any loss of information while a system of strongly
  interacted subsystems cannot be separated without a large loss of information. Among
  all the possible partitions of a system, the partition that minimizes the loss of
  information, called the Minimum Information Partition (MIP), can be considered as
  the optimal partition for characterizing the underlying structures of the system.
  Although the MIP would reveal novel characteristics of the neural system, an exhaustive
  search for the MIP is numerically intractable due to the combinatorial explosion
  of possible partitions. Here, we propose a computationally efficient search to precisely
  identify the MIP among all possible partitions by exploiting the submodularity of
  the measure of information loss, when the measure of information loss is submodular.
  Submodularity is a mathematical property of set functions which is analogous to
  convexity in continuous functions. Mutual information is one such submodular information
  loss function, and is a natural choice for measuring the degree of statistical dependence
  between paired sets of random variables. By using mutual information as a loss function,
  we show that the search for MIP can be performed in a practical order of computational
  time for a reasonably large system (N = 100 ∼ 1000). We also demonstrate that MIP
  search allows for the detection of underlying global structures in a network of
  nonlinear oscillators.
