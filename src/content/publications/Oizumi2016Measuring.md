abstract: 'Accumulating evidence indicates that the capacity to integrate information
  in the brain is a prerequisite for consciousness. Integrated Information Theory
  (IIT) of consciousness provides a mathematical approach to quantifying the information
  integrated in a system, called integrated information, Φ. Integrated information
  is defined theoretically as the amount of information a system generates as a whole,
  above and beyond the amount of information its parts independently generate. IIT
  predicts that the amount of integrated information in the brain should reflect levels
  of consciousness. Empirical evaluation of this theory requires computing integrated
  information from neural data acquired from experiments, although difficulties with
  using the original measure Φ precludes such computations. Although some practical
  measures have been previously proposed, we found that these measures fail to satisfy
  the theoretical requirements as a measure of integrated information. Measures of
  integrated information should satisfy the lower and upper bounds as follows: The
  lower bound of integrated information should be 0 and is equal to 0 when the system
  does not generate information (no information) or when the system comprises independent
  parts (no integration). The upper bound of integrated information is the amount
  of information generated by the whole system. Here we derive the novel practical
  measure Φ* by introducing a concept of mismatched decoding developed from information
  theory. We show that Φ* is properly bounded from below and above, as required, as
  a measure of integrated information. We derive the analytical expression of Φ* under
  the Gaussian assumption, which makes it readily applicable to experimental data.
  Our novel measure Φ* can generally be used as a measure of integrated information
  in research on consciousness, and also as a tool for network analysis on diverse
  areas of biology.'
