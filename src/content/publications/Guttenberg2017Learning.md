abstract: Controlling embodied agents with many actuated degrees of freedom is a challenging
  task. We propose a method that can discover and interpolate between context dependent
  high-level actions or body-affordances. These provide an abstract, low-dimensional
  interface indexing high-dimensional and time- extended action policies. Our method
  is related to recent ap- proaches in the machine learning literature but is conceptually
  simpler and easier to implement. More specifically our method requires the choice
  of a n-dimensional target sensor space that is endowed with a distance metric. The
  method then learns an also n-dimensional embedding of possibly reactive body-affordances
  that spread as far as possible throughout the target sensor space.
