abstract: The cerebral cortex underlies our complex cognitive capabilities, yet little
  is known about the specific genetic loci that influence human cortical structure.
  To identify genetic variants that affect cortical structure, we conducted a genome-wide
  association meta-analysis of brain magnetic resonance imaging data from 51,665 individuals.
  We analyzed the surface area and average thickness of the whole cortex and 34 regions
  with known functional specializations. We identified 199 significant loci and found
  significant enrichment for loci influencing total surface area within regulatory
  elements that are active during prenatal cortical development, supporting the radial
  unit hypothesis. Loci that affect regional surface area cluster near genes in Wnt
  signaling pathways, which influence progenitor expansion and areal identity. Variation
  in cortical structure is genetically correlated with cognitive function, Parkinson’s
  disease, insomnia, depression, neuroticism, and attention deficit hyperactivity
  disorder.
