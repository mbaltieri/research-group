abstract: 'Content generation for video games is a time-consuming process

  that impacts both game development and gameplay in the case of

  sandbox games. One possible approach to alleviate this process is

  to use procedural content generation (PCG), which can automati-

  cally generate diverse content for the game. Lindenmayer systems

  (L-systems) with handcrafted rules have successfully been used

  to generate content for games, but rely on undirected expansion

  of the rules. In contrast, by combining L-systems with an evo-

  lutionary algorithm for constrained optimisation, we are able to

  efficiently utilise simple L-system rules with directed search to

  find functionally-viable and appealing spaceship designs within the

  Space Engineers game'
