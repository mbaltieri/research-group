abstract: Active inference is a formal approach to study cognition based on the notion
  that adaptive agents can be seen as engaging in a process of approximate Bayesian
  inference, via the minimisation of variational and expected free energies. Minimising
  the former provides an account of perceptual processes and learning as evidence
  accumulation, while minimising the latter describes how agents select their actions
  over time. In this way, adaptive agents are able to maximise the likelihood of preferred
  observations or states, given a generative model of the environment. In the literature,
  however, different strategies have been proposed to describe how agents can plan
  their future actions. While they all share the notion that some kind of expected
  free energy offers an appropriate way to score policies, sequences of actions, in
  terms of their desirability, there are different ways to consider the contribution
  of past motor experience to the agent's future behaviour. In some approaches, agents
  are assumed to know their own actions, and use such knowledge to better plan for
  the future. In other approaches, agents are unaware of their actions, and must infer
  their motor behaviour from recent observations in order to plan for the future.
  This difference reflects a standard point of departure in two leading frameworks
  in motor control based on the presence, or not, of an efference copy signal representing
  knowledge about an agent's own actions. In this work we compare the performances
  of action-aware and action-unaware agents in two navigations tasks, showing how
  action-unaware agents can achieve performances comparable to action-aware ones while
  at a severe disadvantage.
