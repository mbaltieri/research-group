abstract: Advancements in calcium indicators and optical techniques have made optical
  neural recording common in neuroscience. As data volumes grow, streamlining the
  analysis pipelines for image preprocessing, signal extraction, and subsequent neural
  activity analyses becomes essential. Challenges in analysis includes 1) ensuring
  data quality of original and processed data at each step. 2) Selecting optimal algorithms
  and their parameters from numerous options, each with its own pros and cons, by
  implementing or installing them manually. 3) systematically recording each analysis
  step for reproducibility 4) adopting standard data formats for data sharing and
  meta-analyses. To address these challenges, we developed Optical Neuroimage Studio
  (OptiNiSt), a scalable, extendable, and reproducible framework for creating calcium
  data analysis pipelines. OptiNiSt includes the following features. 1) Researchers
  can easily create analysis pipelines by selecting multiple processing modules, tuning
  their parameters, and visualizing the results at each step through a graphic user
  interface in a web browser. 2) In addition to pre-installed tools, new analysis
  algorithms can be easily added. 3) Once a processing pipeline is designed, the entire
  workflow with its modules and parameters are stored in a YAML file, which makes
  the pipeline reproducible and deployable on high-performance computing clusters.
  4) OptiNiSt can read image data in a variety of file formats and store the analysis
  results in NWB (Neurodata Without Borders), a standard data format for data sharing.
  We expect that this framework will be helpful in standardizing optical neural data
  analysis protocols.
