abstract: 'Diffusion functional magnetic resonance imaging (DfMRI) has been proposed
  as an alternative functional imaging method to detect brain activity without confounding
  hemodynamic effects. Here, taking advantage of this DfMRI feature, we investigated
  abnormalities of dynamic brain function in a neuropsychiatric disease mouse model
  (glial glutamate transporter-knockdown mice with obsessive–compulsive disorder [OCD]-related
  behavior). Our DfMRI approaches consisted of three analyses: resting state brain
  activity, functional connectivity, and propagation of neural information. We detected
  hyperactivation and biased connectivity across the cortico-striatal-thalamic circuitry,
  which is consistent with known blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD)-fMRI patterns
  in OCD patients. In addition, we performed ignition-driven mean integration (IDMI)
  analysis, which combined activity and connectivity analyses, to evaluate neural
  propagation initiated from brain activation. This analysis revealed an unbalanced
  distribution of neural propagation initiated from intrinsic local activation to
  the global network, while these were not detected by the conventional method with
  BOLD-fMRI. This abnormal function detected by DfMRI was associated with OCD-related
  behavior. Together, our comprehensive DfMRI approaches can successfully provide
  information on dynamic brain function in normal and diseased brains.'
