abstract: Real-world data is often noisy, making it challenging to extract true signals
  Non-invasively recorded neural activities are among the most difficult data, yet
  its precise signal reconstruction is highly anticipated by communities developing
  non-invasive brain-machine interfaces. Several noise sources contribute to this
  challenge, including unrelated neuronal activity, non-brain bioelectricity, attenuation
  by the skull and scalp, and environmental noises. Additionally, the accumulation
  of noise varies significantly across subjects and recording sessions, resulting
  in widely diverging distributions of degraded observations. In this study, we propose
  modeling the noise accumulation process as a Schrödinger bridge and decoding the
  true signal by reversing this process. Compared to conventional guided Diffusion
  approach, our Schrödinger bridge approach effectively models diverse noise processes
  within a single framework, exhibiting greater robustness to inter-subject variability.
  Also, our approach doesn’t require pre-aligning brain and image representations,
  which is an additional compute cost in the conventional approach.
