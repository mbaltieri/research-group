abstract: The variability in brain function forms the basis for our uniqueness. Prior
  studies indicate smaller individual differences and larger inter-subject correlation
  (ISC) in sensorimotor areas than in the association cortex. These studies, deriving
  information from brain activity, leave individual differences in cognitive structures
  based on task similarity relations unexplored. This study quantitatively evaluates
  these differences by integrating ISC, representational similarity analysis, and
  vertex-wise encoding models using functional magnetic resonance imaging across 25
  cognitive tasks. ISC based on cognitive structures enables subject identification
  with 100% accuracy using at least 14 tasks. ISC is larger in the fronto-parietal
  association and higher-order visual cortices, suggesting subject-invariant cognitive
  structures in these regions. Principal component analysis reveals different cognitive
  structure configurations within these regions. This study provides new evidence
  of individual variability and similarity in abstract cognitive structures.
