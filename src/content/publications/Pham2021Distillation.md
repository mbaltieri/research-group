abstract: Multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) has become a standard tool for decoding
  mental states from brain activity patterns. Recent studies have demonstrated that
  MVPA can be applied to decode activity patterns of a certain region from those of
  the other regions. By applying a similar region-to-region decoding technique, we
  examined whether the information represented in the visual areas can be explained
  by those represented in the other visual areas. We first predicted the brain activity
  patterns of an area on the visual pathway from the others, then subtracted the predicted
  patterns from their originals. Subsequently, the visual features were derived from
  these residuals. During the visual perception task, the elimination of the top-down
  signals enhanced the simple visual features represented in the early visual cortices.
  By contrast, the elimination of the bottom-up signals enhanced the complex visual
  features represented in the higher visual cortices. The directions of such modulation
  effects varied across visual perception/imagery tasks, indicating that the information
  flow across the visual cortices is dynamically altered, reflecting the contents
  of visual processing. These results demonstrated that the distillation approach
  is a useful tool to estimate the hidden content of information conveyed across brain
  regions.
