abstract: Consciousness emerges from intricate interactions between neurons in the
  brain. Integrated Information Theory of consciousness (IIT) hypothesizes that the
  amount of information integrated by the interactions within a system, called “integrated
  information (Φ)”, corresponds to the level of consciousness (Tononi, 2004). Integrated
  information conceptually quantifies the amount of information that a system generates
  as a whole, above and beyond the amount of information that its parts independently
  generate (Tononi, 2004). To verify the hypothesis of IIT, it is important to gain
  theoretical insight about in which state of a dynamical system integrated information
  gets high or otherwise. In particular, it is intriguing to elucidate how chaos would
  affect the amount of integrated information. In this study, we investigate how integrated
  information behaves in a chaotic system by using Globally Coupled Map (GCM) (Kaneko,
  1989). GCM is one of the simplest models of a chaotic system but exhibits various
  activity patterns depending on the coupling strengths between the units and the
  bifurcation parameters of each unit. Due to the rich dynamical structure, GCM is
  considered to be a useful model for understanding biological information processing.
  The activity patterns are broadly classified into ordered phases and chaotic phases.
  In the ordered phases, the activities form small a number of clusters while in the
  chaotic phases, the activities do not form such clusters. We investigate how integrated
  information changes depending on the different phases. We show that integrated information
  takes higher values at the boundary areas between chaotic phases and ordered phases
  where the activities are chaotic and the coupling strength is medium. The results
  imply that chaos or the edge of chaos is beneficial for the system to generate high
  amount of information integration and potentially to generate high level of consciousness.
