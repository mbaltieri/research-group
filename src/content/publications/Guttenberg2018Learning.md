abstract: We train a network to generate mappings between training sets and classification
  policies (a 'classifier generator') by conditioning on the entire training set via
  an attentional mechanism. The network is directly optimized for test set performance
  on an training set of related tasks, which is then transferred to unseen 'test'
  tasks. We use this to optimize for performance in the low-data and unsupervised
  learning regimes, and obtain significantly better performance in the 10-50 datapoint
  regime than support vector classifiers, random forests, XGBoost, and k-nearest neighbors
  on a range of small datasets.
