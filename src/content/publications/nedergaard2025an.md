abstract: Learning in environments with sparse rewards remains a fundamental challenge
  in reinforcement learning. Artificial curiosity addresses this limitation through
  intrinsic rewards to guide exploration, however, the precise formulation of these
  rewards has remained elusive. Ideally, such rewards should depend on the agent's
  information about the environment, remaining agnostic to the representation of the
  information -- an invariance central to information geometry. Leveraging information
  geometry, we show that invariance under congruent Markov morphisms and the agent-environment
  interaction, uniquely constrains intrinsic rewards to concave functions of the reciprocal
  occupancy. Additional geometrically motivated restrictions effectively limits the
  candidates to those determined by a real parameter that governs the occupancy space
  geometry. Remarkably, special values of this parameter are found to correspond to
  count-based and maximum entropy exploration, revealing a geometric exploration-exploitation
  trade-off. This framework provides important constraints to the engineering of intrinsic
  reward while integrating foundational exploration methods into a single, cohesive
  model.
