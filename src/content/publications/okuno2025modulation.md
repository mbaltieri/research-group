abstract: We frequently encounter linguistic information in multiple modalities, such
  as text and speech, simultaneously. In such cases, we understand the information
  by selectively attending to one of the modalities. Previous research has shown that
  selective attention to a specific stimulus modality modulates cortical activity
  patterns. However, it remains unclear which aspects of linguistic information are
  selectively modulated by attention and how such modulation influences the decodability
  of semantic content. To address this question, we constructed decoding models of
  latent semantic features from the functional magnetic resonance imaging data of
  six participants in both unimodal (either visual or auditory) and bimodal conditions
  (simultaneously visual and auditory, with participants attending to a single modality
  at a time). In unimodal conditions, we successfully decoded the semantic contents
  from the brain activity. Decodable features were consistent across modalities in
  both intra-modal and cross-modal decoding. For bimodal conditions, decoding accuracies
  for the attended stimuli were higher than for the ignored when training and test
  stimuli belonged to the same modality. Furthermore, decodable features were more
  consistent across modalities with attended than ignored stimuli in both intra-modal
  and cross-modal decoding. These results indicate common decodable semantic features
  regardless of the presentation modality and that selective attention enhances the
  semantic representations contributing to such decodability.
