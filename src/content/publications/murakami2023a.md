abstract: 'Honda aims for zero traffic collision fatalities involving Honda motorcycles
  and automobiles globally by

  2050. To realize a zero traffic‐incident society, we need to minimize human driver
  errors. Improper

  processing of information should trigger human errors during driving, however, despite
  its importance

  for our society, neural mechanisms during driving that can lead to catastrophic
  traffic consequences

  remain unclear. To clarify these, we have researched the relationships among drivers’
  manipulation,

  gaze, and brain activation. In particular, we have focused on the human eye gaze
  because it is not only a

  passive input organ, but also reflects dynamic information processing in the brain.
  To investigate the

  human brain mechanisms involved in safe and secure driving, we scanned the human
  brain using

  functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI) while driving in an MRI‐compatible driving‐simulator.
  We

  introduce one of the experiments showing differential brain activation between safe
  drivers and control

  drivers manipulating a vehicle in ordinary traffic conditions. In this experiment,
  participants were

  healthy adults, and they manipulated the driving‐simulator in the MRI scanner, while
  their driving

  manipulation and gaze were monitored. The participants encountered risk factors
  in the driving

  scenarios. We extracted the difference in the brain activation at gazing some risks
  between the safe

  drivers and control drivers, then the differences in brain activity between safe
  drivers and others were

  found in the precuneus, V1, and SMA. Then we constructed a human‐machine interface
  (HMI) that

  aimed to complement and enhance the cognitive processing which is necessary for
  safe driving. To

  verify the efficacy of our HMI, we conducted experiments by using driving‐simulator
  composed of the

  front part of N‐BOX(Honda) and 5 displays (65 inches), the original system. As a
  result, the suggested

  HMI could have effect on early noticing and avoiding high‐risk object. It is possible,
  therefore, that

  general drivers began to drive more safely with a safe driver‐inspired information
  processing assistance

  system. Our findings will help elaborate the specification of devices for ADAS and
  ADS.'
