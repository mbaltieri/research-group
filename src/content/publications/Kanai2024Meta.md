abstract: In this study, we explore how the notion of meta-representations in Higher-Order
  Theories (HOT) of consciousness can be implemented in computational models. HOT
  suggests that consciousness emerges from meta-representations, which are representations
  of first-order sensory representations. However, translating this abstract concept
  into a concrete computational model, such as those used in artificial intelligence,
  presents a theoretical challenge. For example, a simplistic interpretation of meta-representation
  as a representation of representation makes the notion rather trivial and ubiquitous.
  Here, we propose a refined interpretation of meta-representations. Contrary to the
  simplistic view of meta-representations as mere transformations of the first-order
  representational states or confidence estimates, we argue that meta-representations
  are representations of the processes that generate first-order representations.
  This presents a process-oriented view whereby meta-representations capture the qualitative
  aspect of how sensory information is transformed into first-order representations.
  To concretely illustrate and operationalize thus formulated notion of meta-representation,
  we constructed "meta-networks" designed to explicitly model meta-representations
  within deep learning architectures. Specifically, we constructed meta-networks by
  implementing autoencoders of first-order neural networks. In this architecture,
  the latent spaces embedding those first-order networks correspond to the meta-representations
  of first-order networks. By applying meta-networks to embed neural networks trained
  to encode visual and auditory datasets, we show that the meta-representations of
  first-order networks successfully capture the qualitative aspects of those networks
  by separating the visual and auditory networks in the meta-representation space.
  We argue that such meta-representations would be useful for quantitatively compare
  and contrast the qualitative differences of computational processes. While whether
  such meta-representational systems exist in the human brain remains an open question,
  this formulation of meta-representation offers a new empirically testable hypothesis
  that there are brain regions that represent the processes of transforming a representation
  in one brain region to a representation in another brain region. Furthermore, this
  form of meta-representations might underlie our ability to describe the qualitative
  aspect of sensory experience or qualia.
