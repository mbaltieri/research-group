abstract: Global Workspace Theory (GWT) is a prominent account of cognitive access
  in humans. In the decades since its proposal, there have been a number of computational
  models developed to study the hypothetical dynamics of the global workspace, most
  of which are hand-designed to reflect the expectations of the theory. Here we examine
  a recently successful general deep learning architecture, the Perceiver, as a potential
  theoretical candidate for the global workspace. We find that despite being developed
  in an unrelated context, the Perceiver meets a number of theoretical requirements
  of the global workspace. More importantly, it demonstrates empirical behavior consistent
  with that expected by GWT in both attentional control and working memory tasks drawn
  from the cognitive science literature. Taken together, this evidence suggests that
  the Perceiver and related models may be a useful tool for studying the global workspace
  and its potential realization in both artificial and biological agents.
