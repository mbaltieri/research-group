## Study on the modality-independent organization of vibratory stimuli in the human brain

The haptic processing for vibratory stimulus may partly employ the auditory cortices and vice versa. 
Our research aims to create a comprehensive map of all the brain regions involved in such processing. 
A hypothesis where the stimulus can be presented by activation at somatosensory and auditory systems is proposed and investigated through a series of fMRI experiments.
