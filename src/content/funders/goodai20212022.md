## Using open-ended algorithms to generate video game content

This project aims to test the power of open-endedness in computational creativity and human-machine collaborative design, ending with an algorithm that can create fully functional and visually appealing game content in Space Engineers. 
The project will provide insights about the role of multi-agent interactions in open-ended, lifelong learning, which relates it to GoodAI’s research into lifelong-learning AI (Badger architecture).
