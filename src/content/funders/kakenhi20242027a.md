## Elucidating the Operational Principles of the Brain as a Parallel Information Processing System

While individual consciousness may appear unified, it is actually formed by the highly integrated activity of approximately 100 billion neurons. 
These neurons constitute various functional modules (such as vision, taste, motor control, etc.), with many systems, including the autonomic nervous system, operating automatically. 
Recent brain imaging studies have shown that these neural networks are spontaneously active, and through specific conditions (e.g., Alien Hand Syndrome), it’s possible for the left and right hemispheres of the brain to make different decisions. 
This suggests the potential existence of multiple sensory and decision-making entities within a single individual.
Based on these findings, this research proposes the hypothesis that “consciousness arises from the interaction of parallel operating brain networks” and attempts to verify it using new analytical methods. 
Specifically, as a natural extension of regression analysis, we will use deep learning models consisting of multiple fully connected layers to model cooperative and alienating interactions between networks, visualize the transition process of consciousness, and elucidate the relationship between network interactions and individual consciousness and behavior.
