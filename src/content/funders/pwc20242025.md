## Towards BCIs for intuitive manipulations of computers

This study aims to verify the reduction of physical and mental strain on patients with severe neurological diseases like ALS by using a BMI system to control computer mice, replacing traditional methods like eye-tracking. 
The technology enables brain-controlled computer operation, facilitating smooth, immediate communication and potentially increasing patients’ social participation and quality of life.
