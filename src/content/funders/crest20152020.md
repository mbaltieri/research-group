## Construction of Artificial Consciousness by Combining Axiomatic Computational Theory of Neuroscience and Constructive Theory of Engineering and Its Implementation in Real Life Spaces

Artificial intelligence is now being revolutionalized by the advent of deep neural networks inspired by multilayered structures in the brain along with the availability of big data. 
However, we are yet to create the natural intelligence of biological systems that understands meanings of events and generates voluntary actions. 
In this project, we will implement computational principles offered by contemporary theories of the brain and consciousness, and create artificial systems that have conscious experience, intention and will, and apply this technology to multitudes of data processing in real life environments.
