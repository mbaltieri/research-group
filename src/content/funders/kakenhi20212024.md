## Restructuring human sciences based on decoding of emotional information

The influence of emotion on human behavior is the most fundamental theme of human sciences.
However, it is not easy to construct the mathematical model of human behavior based on the variables of emotion, as the subjective emotion of individuals is not visible. 
Recently, the dramatic advance in machine learning techniques enables us to decode the hidden emotional information from neural and physical information. 
In this project, we will propose new models in the field of human sciences, including linguistics, economics, and aesthetics. 
We are looking for collaborators in the broad areas of Human Sciences as well as neuroscience and data science.
