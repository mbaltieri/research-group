## A principled generalization of the maximum entropy principle for non-Shannon systems

The Maximum Entropy Principle (MEP) is effective for producing unbiased statistical models, yet its standard formulation leaves out many systems of interest.
As these setups gain interest, a principled extension of the MEP is necessary.
This project uses information-geometry to extend the MEP.
