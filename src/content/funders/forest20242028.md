## Computational approach to the representation of brain information in mathematics

Computational cognitive neuroscience is a new field that combines artificial intelligence technology with functional brain imaging technology, but little research has been conducted on mathematical ability. 
This project aims to construct a computational model that comprehensively explains the brain information representation of mathematical thinking through a three-step approach: brain data measurement using functional magnetic resonance imaging, feature extraction using artificial neural networks, and integration of brain data and neural networks using encoding models.
