## Liberation from Biological Limitations via Physical, Cognitive and Perceptual Augmentation

This project aims to develop cybernetic avatars that can be controlled via intention. 
This intention will be estimated from brain activities and information observed on the surface of the human body and through interactions. 
We will integrate intention estimation methods using AI technologies, and enhance the functionality of cybernetic avatars controlled by brain machine interfaces (BMI) while considering ethical implications. 
By 2050, we will create the ultimate BMI-cybernetic avatars that can be freely operated by human intention.
