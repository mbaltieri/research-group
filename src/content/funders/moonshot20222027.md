## Realization of a society where people can live a Maemuki (forward-looking) life in the face of adversity

This project aims to realize a society in which people can live “Maemuki (Forward-looking)” lives even in the midst of adversity. 
To this end, we will clarify the diverse and multifaceted components of “Maemuki (Forward-looking),” calculate Maemuki (Forward-looking) indices by measuring physical posture and brain/physiological reactions, and establish technologies to assist, train, and educate people on Maemuki (Forward-looking) factors tailored to their individual situations through Maemuki (Forward-looking) support technologies.
