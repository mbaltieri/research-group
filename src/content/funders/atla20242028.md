## Development of a Universal Recommendation System Using Digital Twins Mimicking Five-Sense Preferences

The aim of this research is to create a digital twin that mimics an individual’s sensory preferences based on their five senses, and to develop technology for finding optimal targets in cyberspace. 
Using data from electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we will integrate sensory modalities to construct a highly accurate recommendation system. 
In particular, by developing prediction models that incorporate multisensory information including olfactory, gustatory, and tactile senses, we aim to achieve recommendations that accurately reflect individual preferences and sensory experiences.
