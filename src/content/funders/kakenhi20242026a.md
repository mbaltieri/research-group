## Validation of the symbolic estrangement hypothesis using computational modeling and developmental neuroimaging

The symbol estrangement hypothesis suggests that the distance between symbols and objects in the brain becomes more distinct as learning progresses. 
This project examines whether this hypothesis can be simulated on artificial neural networks. 
We will construct encoding models that predict brain activity using neural network features, and clarify the similarity in the learning process of symbolic systems in the human brain and neural networks.
